## Helpful Scryfall queries
The following Scryfall queries are provided as-is for assistance with deckbuilding. Note that there may be false positive inclusions if a card's title contains the creature type, and false negatives for unusual plurals (e.g. Wolves) unless the queries are modified for those cases.

For finding all legendary creatures that could be a hero for a type, use the following query:
```
(game:paper) -is:reserved t:legendary t:creature f:legacy (t:TYPE OR o:/ TYPE[s]?[^a-zA-Z]+/) 
```
For finding all non-legendary creatures valid for a type, use the following query:
```
(game:paper) -is:reserved -t:legendary t:creature f:legacy (t:TYPE OR o:/ TYPE[s]?[^a-zA-Z]+/)
```
For finding all typal noncreature spells valid for a type, use the following query:
```
(game:paper) -is:reserved f:legacy -t:legendary -t:creature (o:/ TYPE[s]?[^a-zA-Z]+/)
```
