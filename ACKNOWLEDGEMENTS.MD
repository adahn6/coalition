### Acknowledgments

* My sibilings: everything I know about playing games, I learned from playing card games with you all growing up. I love you all <3
* Edson: everything I know about Magic, I know from you. This format would never exist without your constant attentiveness to detail, your endless patience for my hairbraned ideas, and your weirdly in-depth knowledge of the comprehensive rules. I love playing Magic with you, and I love you <3
