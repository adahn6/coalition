### Acknowledgments

* **My siblings**: everything I know about playing games, I learned from playing card games with you all growing up. I love you all <3
* **Edson**: everything I know about Magic, I know from you. This format would never exist without your constant attentiveness to detail, your endless patience for my hairbraned ideas, and your weirdly in-depth knowledge of the comprehensive rules.
* **Every player who's playtested**: I immensely appreciate your patience dealing with the shifting rules and restrictions, this format wouldn't be where it is without you all.
