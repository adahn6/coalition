# Game Philosophy and FAQ

## Philosophy

The goal of this format is to provide a multiplayer format that's fun, chaotic, and fast. Ideally, all three matches can be played in around an hour or so and everyone can have a chance to have some high-value interactions and plays. To that end, rules and bans will be tweaked to ensure that this vision of how the games should play can be relatively consistent from table to table. That being said: in any format of Magic, there will always be better decks and worse decks. Play to win, but also win in a way that's appropriate for the environment. If you're playing with friends and have a deck that consistently beats them, consider trying another deck or swapping out some cards. If you're at a tournament, be gracious both in victory and defeat. Above all, have fun.

## Quick rules

### Coming from Commander:
If you're familiar with Commander and just want a quick run down on what's different in this format, here's an itemized summary of what changes:
* **Heroes aren't in the command zone**, they're outside the game. **Once per turn**, you can **put them into hand**-- what you do from there is up to you
  * **No command tax**!
* Players start at **25 life**
* **No color identity** restrictions; but instead, there is the new **typal identity** restrictions
* Decks are **sixty cards** and are **not highlander**
  * 4x lands, 4x creatures  
* **No commander damage** lose condition, but instead a new **Coalition win condition**
  * **All combat damage from all creatures**, plus **any other player damage from your hero**
  * You win the game if you get to 21!
* **Best of 3**
  * **Sideboard** in-between matches, add up the total you got towards your win condition at the end of each match 

## FAQ

### Why isn't this just a Commander variant?
Similar as it may seem on first glance, there are some very important differences in the format definitions. Being able to place the Hero creature in hand alone opens up a very different set of playstyles, and the differences don't stop there. With no concept of command tax, no color identity restrictions, 60 card non-singleton decks, and different win and lose conditions, there's as much different as there is similar. Try it out-- the differences become clear quickly when playing. 

### Why ban fast mana and tutors?
There are two reasons for these restrictions. First, this format can already be extremely fast and chaotic; adding in fast mana or tutors would enable some truly absurd plays that other players may not have chances to respond to. Second, one notable feature in some other formats is that the inconsistency of getting these cards in an opening hand can lead to a sense of unfairness, where that player lucked into the advantage that other players want. That frustration is, overall, understandable and worth minimizing.

### Why not allow other legendary cards?
The choice of legendary creature should really be something special, not just another card in the deck that you happen to have easy access to. To that end, removing other legendary cards helps increase its significance. And furthermore, access to any other legendary cards would dramatically change the power of decks, likely reducing the viability of the Hero creature and increasing the importance of non-Typal legendary spells like planewalkers and artifacts. That change would make the format's power levels harder to regulate while also reducing the typal aesthetic, which is a lose-lose.

### Why can't I choose Human as a typal identity for my deck?
There are a few reasons. Firstly, Humans have the most cards printed by quite a large margin, which creates a incentive to choose them for maximum deckbuilding options; this incentive goes against the spirit of the format's deckbuilding. Second, many creature types have intentional mechanical synergies, but Human comes closer to a default type-- there's no obvious connective gameplay mechanics between most Humans. 

### Can't the victory point condition lead to ties?
Yep, that's a valid observation. But any game of Magic can end in a draw, and a draw doesn't have to invalidate the fun of playing. It's also not particularly likely to happen, from our playtesting, and if it were to happen at excessive rates then rules modifications would be considered.
