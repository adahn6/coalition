# Game Philosophy and FAQ

## Philosophy

The goal of this format is to provide a multiplayer format that's fun and fast. Ideally, all three matches can be played in around ninety minutes and everyone can have a chance to have some high-value interactions and plays. To that end, rules and bans will be tweaked to ensure that this vision of how the games should play can be relatively consistent from table to table. 

This format assumes that decks can and will be constructed competitively. Play to win, but also be respectful and gracious in both victory and defeat.

## FAQ
The following questions are based on discussions when introducing the format to players

### Aren't there already too many formats for Magic?
We get it: many players are jaded and uninterested in learning yet another variation of rules. No one will hold it against you for not being into this format. But please know that *significant care* has been put into this format before debut with the goal of designing a new and fun way to play. Many, many, many cards have been reviewed and inspected. Rules have been tweaked, tossed, rewritten, and rethought. Existing decks from many eras of many formats have been mined for potential ideas. We think the end result is really something special. And if you give it a shot, Coalition may surprise you with what it brings to the table. 

### Why isn't this just a Commander variant?
The overall goal of this format is to provide a *different* multiplayer format from Commander. Similar as a coalition leader may seem to a commander, the inspiration for the mechanic actually lies closer to a generic companion with the restriction "Each card in your starting deck is affiliated with a chosen creature type, or is unaffiliated." These differences aren't just superficial, either. Being able to place the coalition leader in hand alone opens up a very different set of playstyles, and the differences don't stop there. With no concept of command tax, no color identity restrictions, 60 card non-singleton decks, and different win conditions, there's as much different as there is similar. Try it out-- the differences become clear quickly when playing. 

### Why ban fast mana and tutors?
This format can already be extremely fast; adding in fast mana or tutors would enable plays that other players would never have chances to respond to. Additionally, the split 4x/1x deck construction is a considered decision: Your creatures are reliable and consistent, anything else is not. The more powerful tutors undermine this philosophy and thus are banned.

### Why not allow other legendary cards?
The choice of legendary creature should really be something special, not just another card in the deck that you happen to have easy access to. To that end, removing other legendary cards helps increase its significance. Equally importantly, this format gives quite a lot of consistent power to decks by allowing once a turn unpenalized access to a legendary creature card; as a tradeoff for balance, access to other powerful cards must be restricted or the format would be unenjoyable.

### Why does affiliation count more than just a creature's type?
There are plenty of creatures that synergize with creatures outside of their type-- for example, many Artificers create Servos. Checking the entire text of a card allows for cards intended to synergize with each other to be played together. 

### Why does affiliation apply to non-creature cards?
From an aesthetic perspective, this restriction enforces that decks feel 100% committed to their affiliation. But from a format perspective it's extremely important to note that powerful deck archetypes that don't need to care about affiliation emerge if, **as just one example**, [Celestial Colonnade](https://scryfall.com/card/uma/238/celestial-colonnade) and its equivalents can be run at 4x by any deck. These restrictions mean that the everyone, no matter what deck archetypes they're trying to build, has to pay close attention to the affiliation choice and what cards it enables. 

### Why not have affiliation restrictions build similarly to color identity, where any card can be run as long as the type as mentioned on the coalition leader? 
The restriction of a single affiliation is much more straightforward to understand and parse.

### Why can't I choose Human affiliation for my deck?
There are a few reasons. Firstly, Humans have the most cards printed by quite a large margin, which creates a incentive to choose them for maximum deckbuilding options; this incentive goes against the spirit of the format's deckbuilding. Second, many creature types have intentional mechanical synergies, but Human comes closer to a default type-- there's no obvious connective gameplay mechanics between most Humans. 

### Why do decks not just use highlander/singleton restrictions like Commander formats, or the same 4x restrictions for most 60 card formats?
Even at 60 cards, singleton automatically makes many affiliation choices impossible as many creature types just don't have enough creatures worth putting into a deck. Furthermore, this format is born from a love of 60 card playstyles; while 60 card 4x decks are terrific for 1v1 formats, they're just too consistent and powerful for multiplayer. The split 4x/1x is designed to provide plenty of variation across multiple games, but still provide some of the consistency and power that players of most 60 card formats are used to. 

### Why have a custom victory condition instead of just using normal rules?
Firstly, it reinforces a focus on the creatures themselves, especially the nonlegendary ones that make up the backbone of a deck. Secondly, it provides an on-the-table clear indicator to all players of the standings- this element introduces an interesting dynamic that allows for quantifying the table's threats differently than other formats. And lastly, the three-game structure is essentially impossible for a multiplayer format under normal rules and victory points solve this.

### Can't the victory point ranking lead to ties?
Yep, that's a valid observation. But Magic can already end in a draw, and a draw doesn't have to invalidate the fun of playing. It's also not particularly likely to happen, from our playtesting, and if it were to happen at excessive rates then rules modifications would be considered. 

### Why is there no tax for leaders, doesn't that make decks uncontrollable?
Since Coalition is played in sets of three games, letting decks be relatively consistent enables faster games... no one wants to be playing the same match for four hours. Control and stalling tactics will only go so far because of this, and a single combat trick or hasted creature could end the game abruptly just as easily as a complex combo. But if fast scrambles to win the game sound too chaotic, keep in mind that losing a game here doesn't mean as much as other formats; **all players** add their victory points at the end of the game to their ranking. The goal is to individual games moving quickly, still allow for some high-value interactions, and limit frustrations over a single game's results.
