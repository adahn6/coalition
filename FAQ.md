# Game Philosophy and FAQ

## Philosophy

The goal of this format is to provide a multiplayer format that's fun and fast. Ideally, all three matches can be played in around ninety minutes and everyone can have a chance to have some high-value interactions and plays. To that end, rules and bans will be tweaked to ensure that this vision of how the games should play can be relatively consistent from table to table. That being said: in any format of Magic, there will always be better decks and worse decks. Play to win, but also win in a way that's appropriate for the environment. If you're playing with friends and have a deck that consistently beats them, consider trying another deck or swapping out some cards. If you're at a tournament, be gracious both in victory and defeat. Above all, have fun.

## FAQ
The following questions are based on questions that have emerged when explaining and discussing with players.

### Aren't there already too many formats for Magic?
Magic is healthiest when there are many robust choices of how to play. Coalition is born from a desire to see more than just one multiplayer format, and moreover a format that can offer a bridge between 60 card playstyles and Commander. This format encourages players new to 60 card format to develop skills around smaller non-singleton deck construction with sideboarding skills, but in an environment that can still be played socially like many/most games of Commander are. And for 60-card players skeptical of Commander, Coalition provides a halfway point that keeps much of the gameplay they're familiar with but with the legendary creature access of Commander. 

Very little can be said to sway a jaded player disinterested in learning yet another variation of rules. To that end, if the above doesn't sound like your cup of tea, it's understandable to move along. But please know that *significant care* has been put into this format before debut. Many, many, many cards have been reviewed and inspected. Rules have been tweaked, tossed, rewritten, and rethought. Existing decks from many eras of many formats have been mined for potential ideas. If you give it a shot, this format may surprise you with what it brings to the table. 


### Why isn't this just a Commander variant?
The overall goal of this format is to provide a *different* multiplayer format from Commander and the mechanics and rules themselves should reflect that. Similar as a hero may seem to a commander, the inspiration for the mechanic actually lies closer to companion, with the generic companion restriction "Each card in your starting deck is affiliated with a chosen creature type, or is unaffiliated." These differences aren't just superficial, either. Being able to place the Hero creature in hand alone opens up a very different set of playstyles, and the differences don't stop there. With no concept of command tax, no color identity restrictions, 60 card non-singleton decks, and different win and lose conditions, there's as much different as there is similar. Try it out-- the differences become clear quickly when playing. 

### Why ban fast mana and tutors?
This format can already be extremely fast; adding in fast mana or tutors would enable plays that other players would never have chances to respond to. Additionally, the split 4x/1x deck construction is more carefully considered than it may appear. Your creatures are reliable and consistent, anything else is not; the more powerful tutors undermine this and thus are banned.

### Why not allow other legendary cards?
The choice of legendary creature should really be something special, not just another card in the deck that you happen to have easy access to. To that end, removing other legendary cards helps increase its significance. Equally importantly, this format gives quite a lot of consistent power to decks by allowing once a turn unpenalized access to a legendary creature card; as a tradeoff for balance, access to other powerful cards must be restricted or the format would be unenjoyable.

### Why does affiliation count more than just a creature's type?
There are plenty of creatures that synergize with creatures outside of their type-- for example, many Artificers create Servos. Checking the entire text of a card allows for cards intended to synergize with each other to be run together. 

### Why does affiliation apply to non-creature cards?
From an aesthetic perspective, this restriction enforces that decks feel 100% committed to their affiliation. But from a format perspective it's extremely important to note that powerful deck archetypes that don't need to care about affiliation emerge if [Celestial Colonnade](https://scryfall.com/card/uma/238/celestial-colonnade) and its equivalents can be run at 4x by any deck. These restrictions mean that the everyone, no matter what deck archetypes they're trying to build, has to pay close attention to the affiliation choice and what cards it enables. 

### Why not have affiliation restrictions build similarly to color identity, where any card can be run as long as the type as mentioned on the hero? 
This would make card pools when constructing decks and checking for viability very confusing, as well as leading to a problem with legendary creatures mentioning more types becoming *significantly* more powerful. The restriction of a single affiliation is much more straightfoward.

### Why can't I choose Human affiliation for my deck?
There are a few reasons. Firstly, Humans have the most cards printed by quite a large margin, which creates a incentive to choose them for maximum deckbuilding options; this incentive goes against the spirit of the format's deckbuilding. Second, many creature types have intentional mechanical synergies, but Human comes closer to a default type-- there's no obvious connective gameplay mechanics between most Humans. 

### Why do decks not just use highlander/singleton restrictions like Commander formats, or the same 4x restrictions for most 60 card formats?
Even at 60 cards, singleton automatically makes many affiliation choices impossible as many creature types just don't have enough creatures worth putting into a deck. Furthermore, this format is born from a love of 60 card playstyles; while 60 card 4x decks are terrific for 1v1 formats, they're just too consistent and powerful for multiplayer. The split 4x/1x is designed to provide plenty of variation across multiple games, but still provide some of the consistency and power that players of most 60 card formats are used to. 

### Why have a custom victory condition instead of just using normal rules?
Firstly, it reinforces a focus on the creatures themselves, especially the nonlegendary ones that make up the backbone of a deck. Secondly, it provides an on-the-table clear indicator to all players of the standings- this element introduces an interesting dynamic that allows for quantifying the table's threats differently than other formats. And lastly, the best-of-three structure is essentially impossible for a multiplayer format under normal rules and victory points solve this.

### Can't the victory point ranking lead to ties?
Yep, that's a valid observation. But any game of Magic can end in a draw, and a draw doesn't have to invalidate the fun of playing. It's also not particularly likely to happen, from our playtesting, and if it were to happen at excessive rates then rules modifications would be considered.
