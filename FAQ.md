# Game Philosophy and FAQ

## Philosophy

The goal of this format is to provide a multiplayer format that's fun and fast. Ideally, all three matches can be played in around ninety minutes and everyone can have a chance to have some high-value interactions and plays. To that end, rules and bans will be tweaked to ensure that this vision of how the games should play can be relatively consistent from table to table. That being said: in any format of Magic, there will always be better decks and worse decks. Play to win, but also win in a way that's appropriate for the environment. If you're playing with friends and have a deck that consistently beats them, consider trying another deck or swapping out some cards. If you're at a tournament, be gracious both in victory and defeat. Above all, have fun.

## FAQ
The following questions are based on questions that have emerged when explaining and discussing with players.

### Why isn't this just a Commander variant?
The overall goal of this format is to provide a *different* multiplayer format from Commander and the mechanics and rules themselves should reflect that. Similar as a hero may seem to a commander, the inspiration for the mechanic actually lies closer to the original implementation of companion, with the generic companion restriction "Each card in your starting deck is affiliated with a chosen creature type, or is unaffiliated." These differences aren't just superficial, either. Being able to place the Hero creature in hand alone opens up a very different set of playstyles, and the differences don't stop there. With no concept of command tax, no color identity restrictions, 60 card non-singleton decks, and different win and lose conditions, there's as much different as there is similar. Try it out-- the differences become clear quickly when playing. 

### Why ban fast mana and tutors?
There are two reasons for these restrictions. First, this format can already be extremely fast and chaotic; adding in fast mana or tutors would enable some truly absurd plays that other players may not have chances to respond to. Second, one notable feature in some other formats is that the inconsistency of getting these cards in an opening hand can lead to a sense of unfairness, where that player lucked into the advantage that other players want. That frustration is, overall, understandable and worth minimizing.

### Why not allow other legendary cards?
The choice of legendary creature should really be something special, not just another card in the deck that you happen to have easy access to. To that end, removing other legendary cards helps increase its significance. And furthermore, access to any other legendary cards would dramatically change the power of decks, likely reducing the viability of the Hero creature and increasing the importance of non-Typal legendary spells like planewalkers and artifacts. That change would make the format's power levels harder to regulate while also reducing the typal aesthetic, which is a lose-lose.

### Why can't I choose Human as a typal identity for my deck?
There are a few reasons. Firstly, Humans have the most cards printed by quite a large margin, which creates a incentive to choose them for maximum deckbuilding options; this incentive goes against the spirit of the format's deckbuilding. Second, many creature types have intentional mechanical synergies, but Human comes closer to a default type-- there's no obvious connective gameplay mechanics between most Humans. 

### Why do decks not just use highlander/singleton restrictions like Commander formats, or the same 4x restrictions for most 60 card formats?
There are multiple reasons. First and foremost, even at 60 cards, singleton automatically makes many creature types impossible as many creature types just don't have enough creatures worth putting into a deck. Second, it is the intent of this format to provide a multiplayer format that differs from the current formats, which are all singleton. And lastly, this format is born from a love of 60 card playstyles; while 60 card 4x decks are terrific for 1v1 formats, they're just too consistent and powerful for multiplayer. The split 4x/1x is designed to provide plenty of variation across multiple games, but still provide some of the consistency and power that players of most 60 card formats are used to. 

### Why have a custom victory condition instead of just using normal rules?
Two reasons. Firstly, it reinforces a focus on the creatures themselves, especially the nonlegendary ones that make up the backbone of a deck. Secondly, it provides an on-the-table clear indicator to all players of where players are scored- this element introduces an interesting dynamic that allows for quantifying the table's threats differently than other formats. And lastly, the best-of-three structure is essentially impossible for a multiplayer format under normal rules; victory points provide a straightfoward ranking that allows for players to play three and *only* three matches despite multiple players.

### Can't the victory point condition lead to ties?
Yep, that's a valid observation. But any game of Magic can end in a draw, and a draw doesn't have to invalidate the fun of playing. It's also not particularly likely to happen, from our playtesting, and if it were to happen at excessive rates then rules modifications would be considered.
