                        <p>The following section details some advanced strategies for Coalition that may not be obvious to new players. Each of these sections details ways of using the Leader card outside of the most obvious case of casting from hand. Note that these strategies may not be preferable to having the leader in play, they are just options to be aware of!</p>

                        <h2>Card Advantage</h2>
                        <p>For any number of cards that require discarding a card, such as <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/mkm/122/demand-answers">Demand Answers</a>, players can choose to discard the Leader and then optionally transition it back outside the game. Furthermore, some cards like <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/dsc/113/brainstorm">Brainstorm</a> expect cards to be put from hand into the library; in a similar way, players can choose their Leader card but replace the event of being put back into the library and instead transition the Leader card back to outside the game.</p>

                        <h2>Pitch Spells</h2>
                        <p>For any number of <a href="https://scryfall.com/search?q=otag%3Apitch-spell&unique=cards&as=grid&order=edhrec">free spells that require exiling a card from hand</a>, players may move their Leader into hand, then exile the Leader later as part of the spell payment. They may then choose to move the Leader back outside the game.</p>

                        <h2>Renimation</h2>
                        <p>For renimator archetypes, a fairly straightforward game plan can get the Leader card into the graveyard without the need for <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/mmq/168/unmask">additional cards</a> to enable discarding. In order to achieve this, on turn 1, a player should move the Leader into hand and play a land, but cast no cards. Moving to end step, they will then have eight cards in hand and can choose to discard the Leader and keep it in the graveyard. Then, they are set up on turn two to use any of the <a href="https://scryfall.com/search?q=otag%3Areanimate-creature+mv%3C3+f%3Alegacy+game%3Apaper+-is%3Areserved&unique=cards&as=grid&order=name">various reanimate spells</a>.</p>
                        
                        <h2>Delve</h2>
                        <p>Graveyard use isn't limited to reanimate, either; a Leader card can be left in a graveyard to later pay for <a href="https://scryfall.com/search?q=otag%3Adelve+f%3Alegacy+-is%3Areserved+-t%3Alegendary&unique=cards&as=grid&order=edhrec">delve spells</a> more efficiently, and transitioned back outside the game once placed in exile from the delve usage.</p>
