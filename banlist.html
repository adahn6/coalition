                    <h2>Banlist</h2>
                    <p>This ban list uses the <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/banned-restricted-list">Legacy banlist</a> as inspiration, and is a work in progress pending playtesting. Updates will be made semi-regularly as playtests occur.</p>
                    <h2>Guiding Principles</h2>
                    <p>Generally, the preference to not ban cards. However, cards that are overly damaging to the spirit of the format may need to be banned-- as an example, <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/thb/73/thassas-oracle">Thassa's Oracle</a> is currently banned as it is extremely consistent. Similarly, <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/lcc/161/malcolm-keen-eyed-navigator">Malcom, Keen-Eyed Navigator</a> is a two-card combo with <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/m20/141/glint-horn-buccaneer">Glint-Horn Buccaneer</a>. Consistent one and two card combos like these will have a great deal of scrutiny placed on them. Many of the most efficient and powerful fast mana and tutor cards are banned, and scrutiny is applied to any cards with those effects.</p>
                    <div class="tooltip" id="legendaryban">NOTE: Legendary cards that are not your coalition leader are not allowed and are effectively banned.</div>

                            <li>25 cards with the Card Type “Conspiracy.” Click <a href="https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?action=advanced&special=true&type=+%5b%22Conspiracy%22%5d">here</a> for the list.</li>

                            <li>Cards whose art, text, name, or combination thereof that are racially or culturally offensive are banned in all formats. This list is a work in progress. Click <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/news/announcements/depictions-racism-magic-2020-06-10">here</a> for the list.</li>
                            <li>All cards that bring a sticker or an Attraction into the game are banned.</li>

                            <dt><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/fdn/58/bloodthirsty-conqueror">Bloodthirsty Conqueror</a></dt>
                            <dd>Bloodthirsty Conqueror is a two-card combo with <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/m21/127/vito-thorn-of-the-dusk-rose">Vito, Thorn of the Dusk Rose</a>. Two card combos involving the leader card will have extreme scrutiny placed on them, and for now Bloodthirsty Conqueror will be banned as its Sanguine Bond effect is more unique on creatures than Vito's. While Sanguine Bond is still possible to run, at 1x with no good access to fast reanimation, it is much less concerning.</dd>

                            <dd>It's not the power level but rather the sheer annoyance of this card's effect. No one should be stuck waiting while a player orders their entire libary</dd>

                            <dd>With other restrictions from the format, this card isn't the broken fast mana access that it is in other formats, but it's still too relevant to combo lines to permit</dd>
                            <dt><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/lcc/161/malcolm-keen-eyed-navigator)">Malcolm, Keen-Eyed Navigator</a></dt>
                            <dd>Malcolm is just too strong, with extremely consistent access to a two-card combo with <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/m20/141/glint-horn-buccaneer">Glint-Horn Buccaneer</a></dd>

                            <dd>Even as a singleton, Necropotence is a format warping card in any format and could cause unfortunate play patterns</dd>

                            <dd>This effect synergizes too easily with repeatable access to leaders.</dd>
                            <dt><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/cmm/410/sol-ring)">Sol Ring</a></dt>

                            <dd>At 4x access, this card would warp the format heavily in favor of decks that can run this card</dd>
                            <dt><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/thb/161/underworld-breach">Underworld Breach</a></dt>
                            <dd>On the potential unban list. Deckbuilding restrictions make this one a lot harder to work, though obviously it is still very powerful</dd>

                          <dd>Previously banned, this creature is extremely powerful and boosts already well supported coalition types. Unbanned, but playtests may cause further rexamination.</dd>
                        <dt><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/sok/35/erayo-soratami-ascendant-erayos-essence">Erayo, Soratami Ascendant</a></dt>
                          <dd>Banned in Commander for being too straightforward to flip with an extremely powerful effect, this card is on watch for both power and play pattern reasons.</dd>

                          <dd>A classic reanimate target, Griselbrand is an extremely powerful deck even with the lower life totals. On watch</dd>
                         <dt><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/tsr/175/magus-of-the-moon">Magus of the Moon</a></td>
                          <dd>Wizards are an extremely well supported type, and red is a very well represented color. Magus of the Moon gives red Wizard decks a very powerful sideboard option to shut down multicolor opposition, and thus is on watch.</dd>
                        <dt><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/jmp/24/muxus-goblin-grandee">Muxus, Goblin Grandee</a></dt>
                          <dd>Goblins are important for any meta to be healthy, but Muxus may be a bit much. Leaving for watch until further notice</dd>
                        <dt><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/mh3/193/nadu-winged-wisdom">Nadu, Winged Wisdom</a></dt>
                          <dd>Nadu likely needs no introduction, after a near immediate ban in Modern and Commander. Nadu's guaranteeability here makes it quite powerful, but far less access to tutors and Shuko make it a different assessment than other formats</dd>
                        <dt><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/ths/199/prophet-of-kruphix">Prophet of Kruphix</a></dt>
                          <dd>The effect on Prophet of Kruphix is very powerful and potentially extremely annoying, hence its ban in Commander, but the affiliation restrictions **seem** to keep this one from being overly powerful. Subject to change as play patterns are uncovered</dd>
                        <dt><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/mh3/170/sowing-mycospawn">Sowing Mycospawn</a></dt>
                          <dd>Sowing Mycospawn is already banned in Legacy, playtesting is scheduled to determine whether Mycospawn is too efficient for format health.</dd>

                          <dd>Even restricted to a single copy, Up the Beanstalk can provide massive value for decks that use their leaders for high mana value free spells. This behavior isn't unexpected, but Beanstalk may prove to be a bit too much value for healthy play patterns.</dd>
