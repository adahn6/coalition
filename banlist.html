                    <h2>Banlist</h2>
                    <p>This ban list uses the <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/banned-restricted-list">Legacy banlist</a> as inspiration, and is a work in progress pending playtesting. Updates will be made semi-regularly as playtests occur.</p>
                    <h2>Guiding Principles</h2>
                    <p>Generally, the preference to not ban cards. However, cards that are overly damaging to the spirit of the format may need to be banned-- as an example, <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/thb/73/thassas-oracle">Thassa's Oracle</a> is currently banned as it is extremely consistent. Similarly, <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/lcc/161/malcolm-keen-eyed-navigator">Malcom, Keen-Eyed Navigator</a> is a two-card combo with <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/m20/141/glint-horn-buccaneer">Glint-Horn Buccaneer</a>. Consistent one and two card combos like these will have a great deal of scrutiny placed on them. Most access to overly fast mana is currently banned, though <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/uma/236/ancient-tomb">Ancient Tomb</a> is still allowed as it is a land-based mana accelerator and its life cost is significant. Similarly, most tutors have been banned as the consistency of decks is already quite high; new cards with tutor effects may be banned as playtests continue.</p>

                            <dd>Banned in Legacy for good reason, Dreadhorde Arcanist exponentionally boosts two types that already have strong support (wizards and zombies) and creates decks that are just too consistently powerful. There has been discussion around the power level of its effects given the singleton restriction on instants and sorceries; playtests around unbanning it may occur</dd>
                            <dt><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/6ed/186/goblin-recruiter">Goblin Recruiter</a></dt>
                            <dd>It's not the power level but rather the sheer annoyance of this card's effect. No one should be stuck waiting while a player orders their entire libary</dd>
                            <dt><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/jvc/27/gush">Gush</a></dt>
                            <dd>Gush is extremely powerful, but combo player should have tools-- remains banned provisionally, but playtests around it will occur</dd>

                            <dt><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/2x2/308/mana-vault">Mana Vault</a></dt>
                            <dd>Without other restrictions, this card isn't the broken fast mana access that it is in other formats, but it's still too relevant to combo lines to permit</dd>
                            <dt><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/lcc/161/malcolm-keen-eyed-navigator)">Malcolm, Keen-Eyed Navigator</a></dt>
                            <dd>Malcolm is just too strong, with extremely consistent access to a two-card combo with <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/m20/141/glint-horn-buccaneer">Glint-Horn Buccaneer</a></dd>

                            <dt><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/ima/98/necropotence)">Necropotence</a></dt>
                            <dd>Even as a singleton, Necropotence is a format warping card in any format and could cause unfortunate play patterns</dd>

                            <dt><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/thb/73/thassas-oracle">Thassa’s Oracle</a></dt>
                            <dd>At 4x access, this card would warp the format heavily in favor of decks that can run this card</dd>
                            <dt><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/thb/161/underworld-breach">Underworld Breach</a></dt>
                            <dd>On the potential unban list. Deckbuilding restrictions make this one a lot harder to work, though obviously it is still very powerful</dd>

                          <dd>Because of deckbuilding restrictions, this may mostly just end up allowing lesser supported types to be more playable. Subject to testing, may get banned or unbanned repeatedly as play patterns emerge</dd>

                          <dd>A classic reanimate target, Griselbrand is an extremely powerful deck even with the lower life totals. On watch</dd>

                          <dd>The effect on Prophet of Kruphix is very powerful and potentially extremely annoying, hence its ban in Commander, but the affiliation restrictions **seem** to keep this one from being overly powerful. Subject to change as play patterns are uncovered</dd>

                          <dd>This effect is wildly powerful with repeatable access to coalition leaders. Consider this extremely likely to get banned, but playtests around it will happen</dd>
