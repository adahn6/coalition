                    <h2>Banlist</h2>
                    <p>Generally, the preference to not ban cards. However, consistent one and two card combos will have a great deal of scrutiny placed on them, e.g. <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/lcc/161/malcolm-keen-eyed-navigator">Malcom, Keen-Eyed Navigator</a> is banned for being a consistent two-card combo with <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/m20/141/glint-horn-buccaneer">Glint-Horn Buccaneer</a>. Additionally, many of the most efficient and powerful fast mana and tutor cards are banned, and scrutiny is applied to any cards with those effects.</p>
                    <div class="tooltip" id="legendaryban">Legendary cards that are not your coalition leader are not allowed and are effectively banned.</div>

                            <li>Cards whose art, text, name, or combination thereof that are racially or culturally offensive are banned in all formats. This list is a work in progress.

                            <dt><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/ema/2/balance">Balance</a></dt>
                            <dd>While artifact mana is largely restricted, Balance can still be very easily used to gain an immediate game winning advantage.</dd>
                            <dt><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/fdn/58/bloodthirsty-conqueror">Bloodthirsty Conqueror</a></dt>
                            <dd>Bloodthirsty Conqueror is a two-card combo with <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/m21/127/vito-thorn-of-the-dusk-rose">Vito, Thorn of the Dusk Rose</a>. Two card combos involving the leader card will have extreme scrutiny placed on them, and for now Bloodthirsty Conqueror will be banned as its Sanguine Bond effect is more unique on creatures than Vito's. While Sanguine Bond is still possible to run, at 1x with no good access to fast reanimation, it is much less concerning.</dd>
                            <dt><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/ima/157/channel">Channel</a></dt>
                            <dd>While life totals are an important resource in this format, Channel allows for high value leaders and other spells to come out extremely early.</dd>
                            <dt><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/cmm/150/demonic-tutor">Demonic Tutor</a></dt>
                            <dd>Tutor banned based on historical power level and efficiency.</dd>
                            <dt><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/a25/57/flash">Flash</a></dt>
                            <dd>Flash, in combination with guaranteed access to leaders, is far too powerful a tool to be allowed.</dd>
                            <dt><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/6ed/186/goblin-recruiter">Goblin Recruiter</a></dt>
                            <dd>Goblin Recruiter is banned not because of power level but rather the time consuming natue of the card's effect.</dd>
                            <dt><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/2x2/354/imperial-seal">Imperial Seal</a></dt>

                            <dt><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/2x2/308/mana-vault">Mana Vault</a></dt>
                            <dd>Mana Vault was tested as a way to give higher cost leaders more avenues to be competitive, but it proved to be easily recurred by artifact decks for an incredible advantage and is easily tutored for in those decks.</dd>
                            <dt><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/lcc/161/malcolm-keen-eyed-navigator)">Malcolm, Keen-Eyed Navigator</a></dt>
                            <dd>Malcolm pairs with <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/m20/141/glint-horn-buccaneer">Glint-Horn Buccaneer</a> for an early and consistent two card combo.</dd>
                            <dt><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/ema/62/mystical-tutor)">Mystical Tutor</a></dt>
                            <dd>Tutor banned based on historical power level and efficiency.</dd>

                            <dd>Nadu is a design mistake that is understandably removed from almost every format already. While it is not broken on a power level, it's not fun to play with or against.</dd>
                            <dt><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/ima/98/necropotence)">Necropotence</a></dt>
                            <dd>Even as a singleton, Necropotence is a format warping card in any format and could cause unfortunate play patterns</dd>
                            <dt><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/dmr/139/sneak-attack">Sneak Attack</a></dt>
                            <dd>This effect synergizes too easily with repeatable access to leaders.</dd>
                            <dt><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/cmm/410/sol-ring)">Sol Ring</a></dt>
                            <dd>Fast mana banned based on historical power level and efficiency.</dd>
                            <dt><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/ulg/45/tinker">Tinker</a></dt>
                            <dd>While Tinker may only be singleton, its tutor to the battlefield effect is simply too strong an effect.</dd>
                            <dt><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/thb/73/thassas-oracle">Thassa’s Oracle</a></dt>
                            <dd>At 4x access, this card would warp the format heavily in favor of decks that can run this card.</dd>
                            <dt><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/thb/161/underworld-breach">Underworld Breach</a></dt>
                            <dd>As one of the most powerful graveyard recursion spells ever printed, this is format warping even as a singleton.</dd>

                            <dd>Wizards are an extremely well supported type, and red is a very well represented color. Magus of the Moon gives red Wizard decks a very powerful sideboard option to shut down multicolor opposition, and thus is on watch.</dd>
