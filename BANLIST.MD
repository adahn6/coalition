# Banned cards
This ban list uses the [Legacy banlist](https://magic.wizards.com/en/banned-restricted-list) as inspiration, and is a work in progress pending playtesting. Updates will be made semi-regularly as playtests occur. 

## Guiding Principles
Generally, the preference to not ban cards. However, cards that are overly damaging to the spirit of the format may need to be banned-- as an example, [Thassa's Oracle](https://scryfall.com/card/thb/73/thassas-oracle) is currently banned as it is extremely consistent. Similarly, [Malcom, Keen-Eyed Navigator](https://scryfall.com/card/lcc/161/malcolm-keen-eyed-navigator) is a two-card combo with [Glint-Horn Buccaneer](https://scryfall.com/card/m20/141/glint-horn-buccaneer). Consistent one and two card combos like these will have a great deal of scrutiny placed on them. Many of the most efficient and powerful fast mana and tutor cards are banned, and scrutiny is applied to any cards with those effects.

> [!NOTE]
> Legendary cards that are not your coalition leader are not allowed and are effectively banned.

	<dd>This card is already banned in nearly all formats for very good reason</dd>
<dt><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/cmm/150/demonic-tutor">Demonic Tutor</a></dt>
	<dd>Tutor banned based on historical power level and efficiency</dd>
<dt><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/6ed/186/goblin-recruiter">Goblin Recruiter</a></dt>
	<dd>It's not the power level but rather the sheer annoyance of this card's effect. No one should be stuck waiting while a player orders their entire libary</dd>
<dt><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/2x2/354/imperial-seal">Imperial Seal</a></dt>
	<dd>Decks should be consistent enough without tutor</dd>
<dt><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/2xm/270/mana-crypt">Mana Crypt</a></dt>
	<dd>Fast mana banned based on historical power level and efficiency</dd>
<dt><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/2x2/308/mana-vault">Mana Vault</a></dt>
	<dd>With other restrictions from the format, this card isn't the broken fast mana access that it is in other formats, but it's still too relevant to combo lines to permit</dd>
<dt><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/lcc/161/malcolm-keen-eyed-navigator)">Malcolm, Keen-Eyed Navigator</a></dt>
	<dd>Malcolm is just too strong, with extremely consistent access to a two-card combo with <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/m20/141/glint-horn-buccaneer">Glint-Horn Buccaneer</a></dd>
<dt><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/ema/62/mystical-tutor)">Mystical Tutor</a></dt>
	<dd>Tutor banned based on historical power level and efficiency</dd>
<dt><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/ima/98/necropotence)">Necropotence</a></dt>
	<dd>Even as a singleton, Necropotence is a format warping card in any format and could cause unfortunate play patterns</dd>
<dt><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/cmm/410/sol-ring)">Sol Ring</a></dt>
	<dd>Fast mana banned based on historical power level and efficiency</dd>
<dt><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/ulg/45/tinker">Tinker</a></dt>
	<dd>This card is already banned in nearly all formats for very good reason</dd>
<dt><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/thb/73/thassas-oracle">Thassa’s Oracle</a></dt>
	<dd>At 4x access, this card would warp the format heavily in favor of decks that can run this card</dd>
<dt><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/thb/161/underworld-breach">Underworld Breach</a></dt>
	<dd>On the potential unban list. Deckbuilding restrictions make this one a lot harder to work, though obviously it is still very powerful</dd>
<dt><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/cmr/156/vampiric-tutor">Vampiric Tutor</a></dt>
	<dd>Tutor banned based on historical power level and efficiency</dd>

## Current watchlist:
This section contains cards considering bans based on playtesting
<dl>
<dt><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/war/125/dreadhorde-arcanist">Dreadhorde Arcanist</a></td>
    <dd>Previously banned, this creature is extremely powerful and boosts already well supported coalition types. Unbanned, but playtests may cause further rexamination.</dd>
<dt><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/a25/57/flash">Flash</a></dt>
	<dd>Because of deckbuilding restrictions, this may mostly just end up allowing lesser supported types to be more playable. Subject to testing, may get banned or unbanned repeatedly as play patterns emerge</dd>
<dt><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/mm3/72/griselbrand">Griselbrand</a></dt>
	<dd>A classic reanimate target, Griselbrand is an extremely powerful deck even with the lower life totals. On watch</dd>
<dt><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/jmp/24/muxus-goblin-grandee">Muxus, Goblin Grandee</a></dt>
	<dd>Goblins are important for any meta to be healthy, but Muxus may be a bit much. Leaving for watch until further notice</dd>
<dt><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/ths/199/prophet-of-kruphix">Prophet of Kruphix</a></dt>
	<dd>The effect on Prophet of Kruphix is very powerful and potentially extremely annoying, hence its ban in Commander, but the affiliation restrictions **seem** to keep this one from being overly powerful. Subject to change as play patterns are uncovered</dd>
<dt><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/dmr/139/sneak-attack">Sneak Attack</a></dt>
	<dd>This effect is wildly powerful with repeatable access to coalition leaders. Consider this extremely likely to get banned, but playtests around it will happen</dd>
<dt><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/ncc/237/treasure-cruise">Treasure Cruise</a> and <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/ncc/219/dig-through-time">Dig Through Time</a></dt>
	<dd>Unlikely to get banned given current playtests, but historically they are concerning cards in most formats. Still on watch</dd>
</dl>

## Special note:
Despite being silver-bordered, [Frankie Peanuts](https://scryfall.com/card/und/5/frankie-peanuts), beloved Elephant Rogue, is considered legal for sentimental reasons
