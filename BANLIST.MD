# Banned cards
This ban list uses the legacy banlist as inspiration, and is a work in progress pending playtesting. Updates will be made semi-regularly as playtests occur. 

## Guiding Principles
Generally, the preference to not ban cards. However, cards that are overly damaging to the spirit of the format may need to be banned-- as an example, [Thassa's Oracle](https://scryfall.com/card/thb/73/thassas-oracle) is currently banned as its win condition is not one that is in the spirit of the game and is extremely consistent. Most access to overly fast mana is currently banned, though [Ancient Tomb](https://scryfall.com/card/uma/236/ancient-tomb) is still allowed as it is a land-based mana accelerator and its life cost is significant. Similarly, most tutors have been banned as the consistency of decks is already quite high; new cards with tutor effects may be banned as playtests continue.

* [Balance](https://scryfall.com/card/ema/2/balance)
	* This card is already banned in nearly all formats for very good reason.
* [Channel](https://scryfall.com/card/ima/157/channel)
	* This card is already banned in nearly all formats for very good reason.
* [Demonic Tutor](https://scryfall.com/card/cmm/150/demonic-tutor)
	* Decks should be consistent enough without tutors.
* [Dreadhorde Arcanist](https://scryfall.com/card/war/125/dreadhorde-arcanist)
	* Lol no to this one, it is just too good.
* [Goblin Recruiter](https://scryfall.com/card/6ed/186/goblin-recruiter)
	* If we're being honest, it's not the power level but rather the sheer annoyance of this card's effect. No one should be stuck waiting for ten mintues while a player orders their entire libary.
* [Gush](https://scryfall.com/card/jvc/27/gush)
	* It's actually very tempting to see what kind of damage this could do, as combo players should not be out of luck. Remains banned provisionally, but playtests around it are scheduled.
* [Heartless Hidetsugu)[https://scryfall.com/card/cns/144/heartless-hidetsugu]
	* While not strictly impossible to deal with, Heartless Hidetsugu represents a very aggressive way to immediately win the game with maximum victory points and this playstyle is discouraged. 
* [Imperial Seal](https://scryfall.com/card/2x2/354/imperial-seal)
	* Decks should be consistent enough without tutors.
* [Mana Crypt](https://scryfall.com/card/2xm/270/mana-crypt)
	* Access to fast mana is, overall, restricted
* [Mana Vault](https://scryfall.com/card/2x2/308/mana-vault)
	* Without other restrictions, this card isn't the broken fast mana access that it is in other formats, but it's still too relevant to combo lines to let in.
* [Malcolm, Keen-Eyed Navigator](https://scryfall.com/card/lcc/161/malcolm-keen-eyed-navigator)
	* He's just too strong with extremely consistent access to a two-card comb with [Glint-Horn Buccaneer](https://scryfall.com/card/m20/141/glint-horn-buccaneer)
* [Mystical Tutor](https://scryfall.com/card/ema/62/mystical-tutor)
	* Decks should be consistent enough without tutors.
* ["Name Sticker" Goblin](https://scryfall.com/card/unf/107m/name-sticker-goblin
	* Come on, this effect is miserable to deal with and shouldn't be legal in other formats either.
* [Necropotence](https://scryfall.com/card/ima/98/necropotence)
	* Frankly shocking it's legal in Commander.
* [Sensei's Divining Top](https://scryfall.com/card/2x2/314/senseis-divining-top)
	* Decks should be consistent enough without tutors. Also, just annoying.
* [Sol Ring](https://scryfall.com/card/cmm/410/sol-ring)
	* Access to fast mana is, overall, restricted
* [Tinker](https://scryfall.com/card/ulg/45/tinker)
	* This card is already banned in nearly all formats for very good reason.
* [Thassa’s Oracle](https://scryfall.com/card/thb/73/thassas-oracle)
	* The win condition here goes against the overall spirit of the format. Some playtesting will occur, as combo players should have wins, but this one is likely just too much.
* [Underworld Breach](https://scryfall.com/card/thb/161/underworld-breach)
	* On the potential unban list. Format restrictions make this one a lot harder to work, though obviously it is still very powerful
* [Vampiric Tutor](https://scryfall.com/card/cmr/156/vampiric-tutor)
	* Decks should be consistent enough without tutors. 

## Cards banned in Legacy but not Heroic
* [Arcum's Astrolabe](https://scryfall.com/card/mh1/220/arcums-astrolabe)
	* Singleton copies here just aren't as important as in legacy, and there should be some access to flexible mana.
* [Deathrite Shaman](https://scryfall.com/card/ema/215/deathrite-shaman)
	* Possibly concerning, but worth considering unbanned until proven otherwise
* [Dig Through Time](https://scryfall.com/card/ncc/219/dig-through-time)
	* On the one hand, delve is an extremely concerning mechanic-- this is banned/restricted in Legacy/Vintage for good reason. On the other hand, singleton copies without tutor make it much less consistent, and combo players should have some tools in this format. This is *extremely* subject to playtesting and may well change.
* [Demonic Consultation](https://scryfall.com/card/me2/85/demonic-consultation)
	* Not as consistent or strong as in Legacy and Vintage and a good combo piece, could get banned if too strong.
* [Expressive Iteration](https://scryfall.com/card/stx/186/expressive-iteration)
	* There's no reason for this to be banned in this format.
* [Flash](https://scryfall.com/card/a25/57/flash)
	* This is banned from nearly all formats for good reason, but typal restrictions make this one a bit more interesting. Provisionally allowed until playtesting shows its potential.
* [Frantic Search](https://scryfall.com/card/cmm/96/frantic-search)
	* There's no reason for this to be banned in this format.
* [Gitaxian Probe](https://scryfall.com/card/nph/35/gitaxian-probe)
	* Honestly this maybe should stay banned but the effect is less good in multiplayer, and storm / combo should have access to some tools. Possibly gets banned again.
* [Hermit Druid](https://scryfall.com/card/tpr/175/hermit-druid)
	* This card is definitely extremely powerful in Legacy, but the legendary and creature type restrictions may actual prevent it from being nearly as good here. Playtesting required but unbanned until further notice.
* [Lurrus of the Dream-Den](https://scryfall.com/card/iko/226/lurrus-of-the-dream-den)
	* Lurrus is an understandable ban in Legacy but the effect here simply isn't out of line with expected playstyles and other deck restrictions.
* [Mental Misstep](https://scryfall.com/card/nph/38/mental-misstep)
	* Singleton restriction makes this less of an issue than other formats, and life totals are not a non-issue here making the Phyrexian cost actually matter.
* [Mana Drain](https://scryfall.com/card/2x2/57/mana-drain)
	* Counter spells are fine.
* [Mind Twist](https://scryfall.com/card/me3/72/mind-twist)
	* Without access to reserve list cards like [Grim Monolith](https://scryfall.com/card/ulg/126/grim-monolith), and with a multiplayer game, this card is not nearly as good as in other formats.
* [Oath of Druids](https://scryfall.com/card/c16/159/oath-of-druids)
	* If you find a way to make this work for you in a multiplayer game then honestly, werk.
* [Ragavan, Nimble Pilferer](https://scryfall.com/card/mh2/138/ragavan-nimble-pilferer)
	* Unclear what Ragavan's power potential is, may get banned subject to testing.
* [Skullclamp](https://scryfall.com/card/moc/379/skullclamp)
	* Overall, token creation is restricted here between singleton non-creature spells and typal restrictions. Skullclamp could be broken, but the burden of proof is on playtesting.
* [Strip Mine](https://scryfall.com/card/vma/316/strip-mine)
	* Honestly if you're running this in multiplayer you're probably making a mistake.
* [Treasure Cruise](https://scryfall.com/card/ncc/237/treasure-cruise)
	* Same justification for unbanning as [Dig Through Time](https://scryfall.com/card/ncc/219/dig-through-time).
* [White Plume Adventurer](https://scryfall.com/card/clb/49/white-plume-adventurer)
	* The consistency of four of these may be too much, but that seems unlikely at the moment. A win condition is not inherently bad.
* [Windfall](https://scryfall.com/card/cmm/859/windfall)
	* It's frustrating and annoying but again, hard to justify a full ban. Multiplayer means this is just as likely to help an opponent significantly.
* [Zirda, the Dawnwaker](https://scryfall.com/card/iko/233/zirda-the-dawnwaker)
	* A very strong deck archetype but not clearly harmful, consider this unbanned until such harm is proven.

## Current watchlist:
This section contains cards considering bans based on playtesting
* [Treasure Cruise](https://scryfall.com/card/ncc/237/treasure-cruise) and [Dig Through Time](https://scryfall.com/card/ncc/219/dig-through-time)
	* Very likely to get the banhammer, but they need to be truly broken not just extremely good. The concern is that with them, combo players are too good; without them, combo players have fewer tools.
* [Flash](https://scryfall.com/card/a25/57/flash)
	* Because of typal and legendary restrictions, this may mostly just end up allowing lesser supported types to be more playable. Subject to testing, may get unbanned.
* [Muxus, Goblin Grandee](https://scryfall.com/card/jmp/24/muxus-goblin-grandee)
	* Goblins are important for any meta to be healthy, but Muxus may be a bit much. Leaving for watch until further notice.

## Special note:
[Frankie Peanuts](https://scryfall.com/card/und/5/frankie-peanuts), beloved Elephant Rogue, is considered legal for sentimental reasons
