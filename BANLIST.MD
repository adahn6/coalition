# Banned cards
This ban list uses the [Legacy banlist](https://magic.wizards.com/en/banned-restricted-list) as inspiration, and is a work in progress pending playtesting. Updates will be made semi-regularly as playtests occur. 

## Guiding Principles
Generally, the preference to not ban cards. However, cards that are overly damaging to the spirit of the format may need to be banned-- as an example, [Thassa's Oracle](https://scryfall.com/card/thb/73/thassas-oracle) is currently banned as it is extremely consistent. Similarly, [Malcom, Keen-Eyed Navigator](https://scryfall.com/card/lcc/161/malcolm-keen-eyed-navigator) is a two-card combo with [Glint-Horn Buccaneer](https://scryfall.com/card/m20/141/glint-horn-buccaneer). Consistent one and two card combos like these will have a great deal of scrutiny placed on them. Most access to overly fast mana is currently banned, though [Ancient Tomb](https://scryfall.com/card/uma/236/ancient-tomb) is still allowed as it is a land-based mana accelerator and its life cost is significant. Similarly, most tutors have been banned as the consistency of decks is already quite high; new cards with tutor effects may be banned as playtests continue.

<dt><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/ema/2/balance">Balance</a></dt>
	<dd>This card is already banned in nearly all formats for very good reason</dd>
<dt><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/ima/157/channel">Channel</a></dt>
	<dd>This card is already banned in nearly all formats for very good reason</dd>
<dt><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/lcc/220/chandras-ignition">Chandra's Ignition</a></dt>
	<dd>Due to the formats win condition, casting this card on a leader can give a massive and disproportionate amount of victory points for the cost and risk of running it. The ability for this card to swing games creates an unhealthy play pattern and is banned.</dd>
<dt><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/cmm/150/demonic-tutor">Demonic Tutor</a></dt>
	<dd>Decks should be consistent enough without tutors</dd>
<dt><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/war/125/dreadhorde-arcanist">Dreadhorde Arcanist</a></td>
	<dd>Banned in Legacy for good reason, Dreadhorde Arcanist exponentionally boosts two types that already have strong support (wizards and zombies) and creates decks that are just too consistently powerful. There has been discussion around the power level of its effects given the singleton restriction on instants and sorceries; playtests around unbanning it may occur</dd>
<dt><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/6ed/186/goblin-recruiter">Goblin Recruiter</a></dt>
	<dd>It's not the power level but rather the sheer annoyance of this card's effect. No one should be stuck waiting while a player orders their entire libary</dd>
<dt><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/jvc/27/gush">Gush</a></dt>
	<dd>Gush is extremely powerful, but combo player should have tools-- remains banned provisionally, but playtests around it will occur</dd>
<dt><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/cns/144/heartless-hidetsugu">Heartless Hidetsugu</a></dt>
	<dd>While relatively high mana cost and not strictly impossible to deal with, Heartless Hidetsugu is in essence a one-card combo to win</dd>
<dt><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/2x2/354/imperial-seal">Imperial Seal</a></dt>
	<dd>Decks should be consistent enough without tutor</dd>
<dt><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/2xm/270/mana-crypt">Mana Crypt</a></dt>
	<dd>Access to fast mana is, overall, restricted</dd>
<dt><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/2x2/308/mana-vault">Mana Vault</a></dt>
	<dd>Without other restrictions, this card isn't the broken fast mana access that it is in other formats, but it's still too relevant to combo lines to permit</dd>
<dt><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/lcc/161/malcolm-keen-eyed-navigator)">Malcolm, Keen-Eyed Navigator</a></dt>
	<dd>Malcolm is just too strong, with extremely consistent access to a two-card combo with <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/m20/141/glint-horn-buccaneer">Glint-Horn Buccaneer</a></dd>
<dt><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/ema/62/mystical-tutor)">Mystical Tutor</a></dt>
	<dd>Decks should be consistent enough without tutors</dd>
<dt><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/ima/98/necropotence)">Necropotence</a></dt>
	<dd>Even as a singleton, Necropotence is a format warping card in any format and could cause unfortunate play patterns</dd>
<dt><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/cmm/410/sol-ring)">Sol Ring</a></dt>
	<dd>Access to fast mana is, overall, restricted</dd>
<dt><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/ulg/45/tinker">Tinker</a></dt>
	<dd>This card is already banned in nearly all formats for very good reason</dd>
<dt><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/thb/73/thassas-oracle">Thassa’s Oracle</a></dt>
	<dd>At 4x access, this card would warp the format heavily in favor of decks that can run this card</dd>
<dt><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/thb/161/underworld-breach">Underworld Breach</a></dt>
	<dd>On the potential unban list. Deckbuilding restrictions make this one a lot harder to work, though obviously it is still very powerful</dd>
<dt><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/cmr/156/vampiric-tutor">Vampiric Tutor</a></dt>
	<dd>Decks should be consistent enough without tutors</dd>
</dl>


## Cards banned in Legacy but not Coalition

<dl>
<dt><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/mh1/220/arcums-astrolabe">Arcum's Astrolabe</a></dt>
	<dd>Singleton copies here just aren't as important as in legacy, and there should be some access to flexible mana</dd>
<dt><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/ema/215/deathrite-shaman">Deathrite Shaman</a></dt>
	<dd>Possibly concerning, but worth considering unbanned until proven otherwise</dd>
<dt><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/ncc/219/dig-through-time">Dig Through Time</a></dt>
	<dd>On the one hand, delve is an extremely concerning mechanic-- this is banned/restricted in Legacy/Vintage for good reason. On the other hand, singleton copies without tutor make it much less consistent, and combo players should have some tools in this format. This is *extremely** subject to playtesting and may well change</dd>
<dt><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/me2/85/demonic-consultation">Demonic Consultation</a></dt>
	<dd>Not as consistent or strong as in Legacy and Vintage and a good combo piece, could get banned if too strong</dd>
<dt><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/stx/186/expressive-iteration">Expressive Iteration</a></dt>
	<dd>There's no reason for this to be banned in this format</dd>
<dt><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/a25/57/flash">Flash</a></dt>
	<dd>This is banned from nearly all formats for good reason, but deckbuilding restrictions make this one a bit more interesting. Provisionally allowed until playtesting shows its potential</dd>
<dt><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/cmm/96/frantic-search">Frantic Search</a></dt>
	<dd>There's no reason for this to be banned in this format</dd>
<dt><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/nph/35/gitaxian-probe">Gitaxian Probe</a></dt>
	<dd>Honestly this maybe should stay banned but the effect is less good in multiplayer, and storm / combo should have access to some tools. Possibly gets banned again</dd>
<dt><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/tpr/175/hermit-druid">Hermit Druid</a></dt>
	<dd>This card is definitely extremely powerful in Legacy, but deck restrictions keep it in check. Playtesting required but unbanned until further notice</dd>
<dt><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/iko/226/lurrus-of-the-dream-den">Lurrus of the Dream-Den</a></dt>
	<dd>Lurrus is an understandable ban in Legacy but the effect here simply isn't out of line with expected playstyles and other deck restrictions</dd>
<dt><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/nph/38/mental-misstep">Mental Misstep</a></dt>
	<dd>Singleton restriction makes this less of an issue than other formats, and starting life totals make making the Phyrexian cost relatively impactful</dd>
<dt><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/2x2/57/mana-drain">Mana Drain</a></dt>
	<dd>Counter spells are fine</dd>
<dt><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/me3/72/mind-twist">Mind Twist</a></dt>
	<dd>Without access to reserve list cards like <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/ulg/126/grim-monolith">Grim Monolith</a>, and with a multiplayer game, this card is not nearly as good as in other formats</dd>
<dt><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/c16/159/oath-of-druids">Oath of Druids</a></dt>
	<dd>As the format is multiplayer, Oath of Druids is not a safe bet for any player. Legal for now unless consistent harmful play patterns emerge</dd>
<dt><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/mh2/138/ragavan-nimble-pilferer">Ragavan, Nimble Pilferer</a></dt>
	<dd>Unclear what Ragavan's power potential is, may get banned subject to testing</dd>
<dt><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/2x2/314/senseis-divining-top">Sensei's Divining Top</a></dt>
	<dd>Play pattern here could slow down play too much, but the format is aggressive enough that this card is unlikely to be too powerful to allow</dd>
<dt><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/moc/379/skullclamp">Skullclamp</a></dt>
	<dd>Overall, token creation is relatively restricted in this format. Skullclamp could be broken, but the burden of proof is on playtesting</dd>
<dt><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/vma/316/strip-mine">Strip Mine</a></dt>
	<dd>Far too difficult to make effective in a multiplayer format to be worth banning</dd>
<dt><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/ncc/237/treasure-cruise">Treasure Cruise</a></dt>
	<dd>Same justification for unbanning as <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/ncc/219/dig-through-time">Dig Through Time</a></dd>
<dt><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/clb/49/white-plume-adventurer">White Plume Adventurer</a></dt>
	<dd>The consistency of four of these may be too much, but that seems unlikely at the moment. A win condition is not inherently bad</dd>
<dt><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/cmm/859/windfall">Windfall</a></dt>
	<dd>It's frustrating and annoying but again, hard to justify a full ban. Multiplayer means this is just as likely to help an opponent significantly</dd>
<dt><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/iko/233/zirda-the-dawnwaker">Zirda, the Dawnwaker</a></dt>
	<dd>A very strong deck archetype but not clearly harmful, consider this unbanned until such harm is proven</dd>
</dl>

## Current watchlist:
This section contains cards considering bans based on playtesting
<dl>
<dt><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/frf/91/arcbond">Arcbond</a></dt>
	<dd>This card can do quite a lot towards the format's win condition, and could potentially become too powerful to allow. But right now, it seems likelier to be a fun trick to turn tables on opponents, so it's staying in pending playtests</dd>
<dt><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/a25/57/flash">Flash</a></dt>
	<dd>Because of deckbuilding restrictions, this may mostly just end up allowing lesser supported types to be more playable. Subject to testing, may get banned or unbanned repeatedly as play patterns emerge</dd>
<dt><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/mm3/72/griselbrand">Griselbrand</a></dt>
	<dd>A classic reanimate target, Griselbrand is an extremely powerful deck even with the lower life totals. On watch</dd>
<dt><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/jmp/24/muxus-goblin-grandee">Muxus, Goblin Grandee</a></dt>
	<dd>Goblins are important for any meta to be healthy, but Muxus may be a bit much. Leaving for watch until further notice</dd>
<dt><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/ths/199/prophet-of-kruphix">Prophet of Kruphix</a></dt>
	<dd>The effect on Prophet of Kruphix is very powerful and potentially extremely annoying, hence its ban in Commander, but the affiliation restrictions **seem** to keep this one from being overly powerful. Subject to change as play patterns are uncovered</dd>
<dt><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/dmr/139/sneak-attack">Sneak Attack</a></dt>
	<dd>This effect is wildly powerful with repeatable access to coalition leaders. Consider this extremely likely to get banned, but playtests around it will happen</dd>
<dt><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/sld/728/themberchaud">Themberchaud</a></dt>
	<dd>Themberchaud, along with several other creatures, has the power for significant non-combat damage sourced from the coalition leader. Especially as Flash is provisionally being allowed in, this card could lead to bad games. As of writing, this note is more that these types of effects will have an eye kept on them as playtesting happens</dd>
<dt><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/ncc/237/treasure-cruise">Treasure Cruise</a> and <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/ncc/219/dig-through-time">Dig Through Time</a></dt>
	<dd>Unlikely to get banned given current playtests, but historically they are concerning cards in most formats. Still on watch</dd>
</dl>

## Special note:
[Frankie Peanuts](https://scryfall.com/card/und/5/frankie-peanuts), beloved Elephant Rogue, is considered legal for sentimental reasons
