# Banned cards
This ban list uses the legacy banlist as inspiration, and is a work in progress pending playtesting. Updates will be made semi-regularly as playtests occur. 

## Guiding Principles
Generally, the preference to not ban cards. However, cards that are overly damaging to the spirit of the format may need to be banned-- as an example, [Thassa's Oracle](https://scryfall.com/card/thb/73/thassas-oracle) is currently banned as its win condition is not one that is in the spirit of the game and is extremely consistent. Most access to overly fast mana is currently banned, though [Ancient Tomb](https://scryfall.com/card/uma/236/ancient-tomb) is still allowed; this is subject to further playtesting. Similarly, most tutors have been banned as the consistency of decks is already quite high; new cards with tutor effects may be banned as playtests continue.

## List
* All cards on the reserve list. Click [here](https://magic.wizards.com/en/news/announcements/official-reprint-policy) for the list.
* 25 cards with the Card Type “Conspiracy.” Click [here](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?action=advanced&special=true&type=+%5b%22Conspiracy%22%5d) for the list.
* 9 cards that reference "playing for ante." Click [here](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?action=advanced&text=+%5b%22%20ante.%22%5d) for the list.

* [Balance](https://scryfall.com/card/ema/2/balance)
	* This card is already banned in nearly all formats for very good reason.
* [Channel](https://scryfall.com/card/ima/157/channel)
	* This card is already banned in nearly all formats for very good reason.
* [Demonic Consultation](https://scryfall.com/card/me2/85/demonic-consultation)
	* While not as consistent or strong as in Legacy and Vintage, it's still too powerful of a combo piece, especially when coupled with permanent access to a legendary creature combo piece.
* [Demonic Tutor](https://scryfall.com/card/cmm/150/demonic-tutor)
	* Decks should be consistent enough without tutors.
* [Flash](https://scryfall.com/card/a25/57/flash)
	* Banned from nearly all formats except somehow Oathbreaker, this card is way too powerful to allow.
* [Goblin Recruiter](https://scryfall.com/card/6ed/186/goblin-recruiter)
	* If we're being honest, it's not the power level but rather the sheer annoyance of this card's effect. No one should be stuck waiting for ten mintues while a player orders their entire libary.
* [Gush](https://scryfall.com/card/jvc/27/gush)
	* It's actually very tempting to see what kind of damage this could do, as combo players should not be out of luck. Remains banned provisionally, but playtests around it are scheduled.
* [Imperial Seal](https://scryfall.com/card/2x2/354/imperial-seal)
	* Decks should be consistent enough without tutors.
* [Mana Crypt](https://scryfall.com/card/2xm/270/mana-crypt)
	* Access to fast mana is, overall, restricted
* [Mana Vault](https://scryfall.com/card/2xm/270/mana-vault)
	* Access to fast mana is, overall, restricted
* [Mental Misstep](https://scryfall.com/card/nph/38/mental-misstep)
	* Tempting to let it in given the singleton format. Discussions will ensue.
* [Mystical Tutor](https://scryfall.com/card/ema/62/mystical-tutor)
	* Decks should be consistent enough without tutors.
* [Necropotence](https://scryfall.com/card/ima/98/necropotence)
	* Frankly shocking it's legal in Commander.
* [Sensei's Divining Top](https://scryfall.com/card/2x2/314/senseis-divining-top)
	* Decks should be consistent enough without tutors. Also, just annoying.
* [Sol Ring](https://scryfall.com/card/cmm/410/sol-ring)
	* Access to fast mana is, overall, restricted
* [Tinker](https://scryfall.com/card/ulg/45/tinker)
	* This card is already banned in nearly all formats for very good reason.
* [Thassa’s Oracle](https://scryfall.com/card/thb/73/thassas-oracle)
	* The win condition here goes against the overall spirit of the format. Some playtesting will occur, as combo players should have wins, but this one is likely just too much.
* [Underworld Breach](https://scryfall.com/card/thb/161/underworld-breach)
	* I mean, if we really want to break the format we can unban this AND [Hermit Druid](https://scryfall.com/card/tpr/175/hermit-druid) and watch someon win T3 consistently lmao
* [Vampiric Tutor](https://scryfall.com/card/cmr/156/vampiric-tutor)
	* Decks should be consistent enough without tutors. 
* [Zirda, the Dawnwaker](https://scryfall.com/card/iko/233/zirda-the-dawnwaker)
	* The beautiful elemental fox is simply too, too good. Hands down would be the best card in the format.

## Cards banned in Legacy but not Heroic
* [Arcum's Astrolabe](https://scryfall.com/card/mh1/220/arcums-astrolabe)
	* Singleton copies here just aren't as important as in legacy, and there should be some access to flexible mana.
* [Deathrite Shaman](https://scryfall.com/card/ema/215/deathrite-shaman)
	* Possibly concerning, but worth considering unbanned until proven otherwise
* [Dig Through Time](https://scryfall.com/card/ncc/219/dig-through-time)
	* On the one hand, delve is an extremely concerning mechanic-- this is banned/restricted in Legacy/Vintage for good reason. On the other hand, singleton copies without tutor make it much less consistent, and combo players should have some tools in this format. This is *extremely* subject to playtesting and may well change.
* [Dreadhorde Arcanist](https://scryfall.com/card/war/125/dreadhorde-arcanist)
	* It's a very powerful card and running 4x makes it very good. But its playstyle is within the spirit of the game, so it will only be banned subject to significant power level issues.
* [Expressive Iteration](https://scryfall.com/card/stx/186/expressive-iteration)
	* There's no reason for this to be banned in this format.
* [Frantic Search](https://scryfall.com/card/cmm/96/frantic-search)
	* There's no reason for this to be banned in this format.
* [Gitaxian Probe](https://scryfall.com/card/nph/35/gitaxian-probe)
	* Honestly this maybe should stay banned but the effect is less good in multiplayer, and storm / combo should have access to some tools. Possibly gets banned again.
* [Hermit Druid](https://scryfall.com/card/tpr/175/hermit-druid)
	* This card is definitely extremely powerful in Legacy, but the legendary and creature type restrictions may actual prevent it from being nearly as good here. Playtesting required but unbanned until further notice.
* [Lurrus of the Dream-Den](https://scryfall.com/card/iko/226/lurrus-of-the-dream-den)
	* Lurrus is an understandable ban in Legacy but the effect here simply isn't out of line with playstyles. Obviously, subject to playtest.
* [Mana Drain](https://scryfall.com/card/2x2/57/mana-drain)
	* Counter spells are fine.
* [Mind Twist](https://scryfall.com/card/me3/72/mind-twist)
	* Without access to reserve list cards like [Grim Monolith](https://scryfall.com/card/ulg/126/grim-monolith), and with a multiplayer game, this card is not nearly as good as in other formats.
* [Oath of Druids](https://scryfall.com/card/c16/159/oath-of-druids)
	* If you find a way to make this work for you in a multiplayer game then honestly, werk.
* [Ragavan, Nimble Pilferer](https://scryfall.com/card/mh2/138/ragavan-nimble-pilferer)
	* On the one hand, lmao. On the other hand, lmao. Ragavan is an exceptionally good card and will likely break the meta, but let's see how it plays out. **PROVISIONAL**
* [Skullclamp](https://scryfall.com/card/moc/379/skullclamp)
	* Overall, token creation is restricted here between singleton non-creature spells and typal restrictions. Skullclamp could be broken, but the burden of proof is on playtesting.
* [Strip Mine](https://scryfall.com/card/vma/316/strip-mine)
	* Honestly if you're running this in multiplayer you're probably making a mistake.
* [Treasure Cruise](https://scryfall.com/card/ncc/237/treasure-cruise)
	* More likely than [Dig Through Time](https://scryfall.com/card/ncc/219/dig-through-time) to get banned again, but same justification for unbanning.
* [White Plume Adventurer](https://scryfall.com/card/clb/49/white-plume-adventurer)
	* The consistency of four of these may be too much, but that seems unlikely at the moment. A win condition is not inherently bad.
* [Windfall](https://scryfall.com/card/cmm/859/windfall)
	* It's frustrating and annoying but again, hard to justify a full ban. Multiplayer means this is just as likely to help an opponent significantly.


## Current watchlist:
This section contains cards considering bans based on playtesting
* 1 MV Tutors: Extremely likely to be banned, primarily to keep consistency with the overall approach to banning high value non-creature tutors. That being said, they are not currently banned. The watchlist tutors are:
	* [Enlightened Tutor](https://scryfall.com/card/ema/9/enlightened-tutor)
	* [Personal Tutor](https://scryfall.com/card/cmm/110/personal-tutor)
	* [Steelshaper's Gift](https://scryfall.com/card/cmm/59/steelshapers-gift)
	* [Sylvan Tutor](https://scryfall.com/card/me4/169/sylvan-tutor)
	* [Worldly Tutor](https://scryfall.com/card/cc1/6/worldly-tutor)
	* Note that technically [Entomb](https://scryfall.com/card/uma/94/entomb) could be argued to fit the bill for this principle as well.
* [Plague Engineer](https://scryfall.com/card/mh1/100/plague-engineer) and [Engineered Plague](https://scryfall.com/card/7ed/133/engineered-plague)
	* There are 65 cards that specify choosing a creature type, but only these two provide ongoing debuffs. Feels dangerously close to player hate, but provisionally allowed.
* [Ancient Tomb](https://scryfall.com/card/uma/236/ancient-tomb)
	* By far the fastest mana available in the format, this is a rare exception to the legendary lands etc. If we're being honest, I'd probably rather ban this, but add an alternative card similar to command tower.

## Special note:
[Frankie Peanuts](https://scryfall.com/card/und/5/frankie-peanuts), beloved Elephant Rogue, is considered legal for sentimental reasons
