                    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
                    <p>This section addresses commonly asked questions about the format and are all based on real conversations had with players.</p>
                    <div class="banlist">
                        <dl>
                            <dt>Aren't there already too many formats for Magic? Couldn't this just be a Commander variant?</dt>
                            <dd>Coalition offers a new and interesting way to build decks and play Magic. Other formats are great too-- but Coalition isn't just a spinoff or variant.</dd>  
                            <dt>Does it have to be 4 players?</dt>
                            <dd>No, Coalition's rules are flexible. Three player matches are a lot of fun too, and five is possible though may feel clunky. However, your playgroup should consider adjusting rules and discuss deck expectations if playing with non-standard player counts, as keeping the games dynamic but also within about 30 minutes is an important to the match structure.</dd>
                            <dt>Does this have to be played competitively?</dt>
                            <dd>Not at all! Just make sure your playgroup is on the same page about power level expectations. But also be aware that the format was designed with high-power competitive play in mind.</dd>
                            <dt>Why not allow other legendary cards?</dt>
                            <dd>The choice of legendary creature should really be something special, not just another card in the deck that you happen to have easy access to.</dd>
                            <dt>Why does affiliation count more than just a creature's type?</dt>
                            <dd>There are plenty of creatures that synergize with creatures outside of their own type-- for example, <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/mh3/290/kaalia-of-the-vast">Kaalia of the Vast</a> would not offer any interesting deck possibilities just based on the card's creature types of Human Cleric. Affiliation, rather than strict "cards of a creature type", addresses this while still allowing for decks built around a single creature type.</dd>
                            <dt>Why can't I choose Human affiliation for my deck?</dt>
                            <dd>Humans have the most cards printed by quite a large margin; almost 4x the second most printed types, and 10x or more for many others) creates a incentive to choose them simply for maximum deckbuilding options. This incentive goes against the spirit of the format's deckbuilding and is thus banned.</dd>
                            <dt>Doesn't the victory point system exclude play styles?</dt>
                            <dd>Winning guarantees 21 victory points, so you can try to win with any method you want. However, if you solely rely on an alternate win condition without accruing victory points during the match, you're taking on a lot of risk-- secure the win and you're fine, but you'll be much further behind if you lose. In general, this keeps the pressure on high-powered multi card combos: it's possible to run them and win a single game, but it'll take creativity, skill, and some luck to make that work often enough to win you the entire match.</dd>
                            <dt>Why can't I run Shapeshifters in decks of any creature type?</dt>
                            <dd>Shapeshifter is just a creature type, so Shapeshifter cards are subject to the same deckbuilding restrictions as any other cards with a creature type. However, you may be conflating Shapeshifter with their frequently associated ability, Changeling: Changeling is not a creature type, but rather an characteristic-defining ability that gives a card with it all creature types at all times. Because of this, Shapeshifter cards with Changeling can be run in any deck. <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/dmc/24/activated-sleeper">Shapeshifter</a> cards without it, though, will have to be in a Shapeshifter coalition type deck.</dd>
                            <dt>Why does the turn order have to depend on victory points?</dt>
                            <dd>Going first in any format is a significant advantage; penalizing the current player in the lead allows for balance across the multiple games in a match.</dd>
