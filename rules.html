                    <h2>Comprehensive Rules Modification</h2>
                    <p>A WIP modification of Magic The Gathering: Comprehensive Rules for "Coalition":
                    <div class="banlist">
                        <h3 id="906-coalition">906. Coalition</h3>
                        <ul>
                        <li>906.1. In the Coalition variant, each deck forms a coalition led by legendary creature and its allies. The Coalition format was created by fans. The Coalition variant uses all the normal rules for a Magic game, with the following additions.
                        </li>
                        <li>906.2. A Coalition match is set of exactly three multiplayer games; this is a modification of 100.6a. The default multiplayer setup is the Free-for-All variant with the attack multiple players option and without the limited range of influence option. See rule 806, “Free-for-All Variant.”
                        </li>
                        <li>906.3. Each deck has a legendary creature card designated as its "coalition leader". This designation is not a characteristic of the object represented by the card; rather, it is an attribute of the card itself. The card retains this designation even when it changes zones.
                        <ul>
                        <li>Example: A coalition leader that’s been turned face down (due to Ixidron’s effect, for example) is still a coalition leader. A coalition leader that’s copying another card (due to Cytoshape’s effect, for example) is still a coalition leader. A permanent that’s copying a coalition leader (such as a Body Double, for example, copying a coalition leader in a player’s graveyard) is not a coalition leader
                        </li>
                        <li>906.3a Double-faced cards can be the coalition leader as long as the front face of the card has the types legendary creature.
                        </li>
                        </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>906.4 The Coalition variant uses affiliation to determine what cards can be in a deck with a certain coalition leader. A card is affiliated with all creature types that it is, as well as each creature type printed on the Oracle text of the card, including its creature types and any ability text of the card. 
                        <ul>
                        <li>906.4a Affiliation is established before the game begins, and is affected by characteristic defining abilities like Changeling and other relevant abilities that modify card values in specific zones.
                        <ul>
                        <li>Example: Morphon the Boundless is affiliated with all creature types, as it has changeling.
                        </li>
                        <li>Example: Grist, the Hunger Tide is an Insect creature affiliated with Insects during deck construction
                        </li>
                        </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>906.4b Reminder text is ignored when determining affiliation.
                        </li>
                        <li>906.4c The back face of a double-faced card is included when determining a card's affiliation. This is an exception to rule 712.8a.
                        </li>
                        </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>906.5 Each Coalition deck is subject to the following deck construction rules.
                        <ul>
                        <li>906.5a Each deck must contain exactly 60 cards and a 15 card sideboard. The coalition leader starts the game in the sideboard and is not part of the 60 card main deck.
                        </li>
                        <li>906.5b Each creature card may be included a maximum of four times.
                        </li>
                        <li>906.5c Each non-basic land card may be included a maximum of four times.
                        </li>
                        <li>906.5d Each non-creature, non-land card must have a different English name.
                        </li>
                        <li>906.5e Every card in a Coalition deck and its sideboard must share a chosen affiliation, referred to as its coalition type. Unaffiliated cards are not subject to this restriction. This type may not be Human.
                        </li>
                        <li>906.5f The deck must contain a legendary creature in its sideboard, designated its coalition leader.
                        </li>
                        <li>906.5g The deck must not contain banned cards. A ban list is maintained in this repository.
                        </li>
                        <li>906.5h The deck must not contain any legendary cards except the legendary creature declared as the coalition leader. This restriction includes double-faced cards with only a legendary back-face; this is an exception to 712.8a.
                        </li>
                        </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>906.6 The Coalition variant includes the following specification for victory points.
                        <ul>
                        <li>906.6a A player starts each game with 0 victory points
                        </li>
                        <li>906.6b A player receives victory points equal to any combat damage dealt to opponents by creatures they control
                        </li>
                        <li>906.6c A player may not receive more than 21 victory points in a game
                        </li>
                        <li>906.6d A player who wins the game through any means receives all remaining victory points they can receive, to the maximum of 21
                        </li>
                        <li>906.6e Victory points are not counters and they cannot be removed or interacted with by any effects that affect counters such as proliferate.
                        </li>
                        <li>906.6f A player who concedes the game at any time loses all victory points from the current game and may not participate in further games
                        </li>
                        <li>906.6g As an exception, if all opponents remaining in the current game wish to concede to a player simultaneously, 906.6g does not apply to any of them
                        </li>
                        <li>906.6h At the end of each game, each player adds their victory points earned during that game to their cumulative total for the match, referred to as their ranking
                        </li>
                        </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>906.7 The Coalition variant includes the following specification for winning and losing a game. All other rules for ending a game also apply. (See rule 104.)
                        <ul>
                        <li>906.7a A player who has 21 victory points wins the game (This is a state-based action. See rule 704.)
                        </li>
                        <li>906.7b If two or more players have 21 victory points simultaneously, the game is considered a draw
                        </li>
                        <li>906.7c If the games ends in a draw for any reason, 906.6d does not apply to any player
                        </li>
                        <li>906.7d If the game has no winner for any other reason, 906.6d does not apply to any player
                        </li>
                        </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>906.8 The winner of a Coalition match is the player or players with the highest ranking (see 906.6h). 
                        </li>
                        <li>906.9 For each game, once the starting player has been determined, each player sets their life total to 25 and draws a hand of seven cards.
                        <ul>
                        <li>906.9a The starting player should be determined randomly for the first game
                        </li>
                        <li>906.9b For the subsequent games, the starting player is chosen by the player ranked last
                        </li>
                        </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>906.10 Once on each of their turns, a player may put their coalition leader card from outside the game into their hand. This is a special action. A player can take this action any time they have priority and the stack is empty during a main phase of their turn, but only if they haven’t done so yet this turn.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>906.11. A coalition leader may return to outside the game during a Coalition game.
                            <ul>
                                <li>906.11a If a coalition leader is in a graveyard or in exile and that object was put into that zone since the last time state-based actions were checked, its owner may remove it from the game. This is a state-based action. See rule 704.</li>
                                <li>906.11b If a coalition leader would be put into its owner’s hand or library from anywhere, its owner may remove it from the game instead. This replacement effect may apply more than once to the same event. This is an exception to rule 614.5.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
