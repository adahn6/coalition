                <p>A fast, high-power multiplayer format about creatures, combat, cooperation, and competition</p>
            </div>
            <hr />
            <p>In Coalition, you'll choose a legendary creature as a coalition leader, then build a 60-card deck plus sideboard around one of its creature type affiliations.</p>
            <p>Coalition is played as a match of three games in which players compete for the most victory points. Players earn victory points equal to the combat damage they deal to opponents-- reaching 21 victory points immediately wins the game. At the end of each game, each player adds all victory points they earned during the game to their ranking. The player with the highest ranking at the end of the match wins.</p>
            <p>Coalition remixes a lot of elements from other formats into its own unique spin on Magic. Give it a try-- we think you'll have a blast.</p>
