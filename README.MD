# Heroic format
A new multiplayer format intended to be faster, cheaper, more consistent, and more aggressive than Commander. Build a deck around a legendary hero creature, fill the deck with cards of that type. But no other legendaries allowed! As your hero deals damage or kills other creatures, it will level up making it increasingly dangerous. The goal of the format is make fast, aggressive decks dealing combat damage to players a first-class win condition. 

## Why Play This Format?
* Fast paced multi-player games
* Decks feature flavorful creature type themes
* Eternal format
* Differences from Commander offer an alternative closer to Legacy's companions 

## Play Rules/Modifiers
This format is for 3-5 players per game and deck sizes are 60 cards + 8 sideboard cards. Players start with 25 life.

In Heroic format, you'll build a deck around a legendary hero creature leading a creature type army into battle. As your hero deals player damage or kills other creatures, it will level up making it increasingly dangerous.

## Typal identity
A card's typal identity comes from any part of that card that references a creature type, including its creature type or any creature type in its text. Every card in your Heroic deck must share a single typal identity, or have no typal identity.

## Hero's Damage
You win you the game if creatures you own deal 18 total damage to players. 

## Hero Levels
As your hero gains experience, it will level up. You start the game with a “Hero Level” emblem. The first time each turn your hero creature deals player damage or kills a creature, it gains its next ability. Hero levels are gained from top to bottom and once they are gained they are kept for the rest of the game. 

Whenever a hero creature you own levels up, look the top card of your library. You may put that card into hand. If you don't, exile it and add one colorless mana. Until end of turn, you don’t lose mana added this way as steps and phases end, and you may spend this mana as if it was mana of any type.

### Deck Restrictions: 
* No cards from the [banned cards list](BANLIST.MD)
* No legendary cards other than your hero in your 68 total cards
	* No companion or partner
* All cards in your deck share a single typal identity with your hero creature, or have no typal identity. This type may not be Human.
	* Typal identity is defined as “All creature types printed on the card, with the exception of ‘non-‘ type clauses”
		* Example: You can choose [Kaalia of the Vast](https://scryfall.com/card/2x2/235/kaalia-of-the-vast) and choose the Dragon type printed in her ability
		* Example: You can run [Portal to Phyrexia](https://scryfall.com/card/bro/240/portal-to-phyrexia) only if you are choosing Phyrexian creature type
		* Example: You can run [Swan Song](https://scryfall.com/card/c16/98/swan-song) only if you are choosing Bird creature type
		* Example: You can run [Bestial Menace](https://scryfall.com/card/mic/134/bestial-menace) if you are choosing any of Snake, Wolf, or Elephant types
		* Example: You can run [Aether Chaser](https://scryfall.com/card/aer/76/aether-chaser) if you are choosing either Artificer or Servo types
	* Note: “Non-[Creature Type]” clauses do not count as a creature type for this purpose
		* Example: All decks can run [Embiggen](https://scryfall.com/card/unf/137/embiggen) as its text “target non-Brushwagg creature” does not count as referencing the Brushwagg creature type
	* Cards with changeling may be chosen for the legendary creature and may be included in any deck, however a singular shared type must be used for all cards that do not have changeling.
		* Example: [Morophon the Boundless](https://scryfall.com/card/cmm/3/morophon-the-boundless) can be chosen as the legendary, but that doesn’t mean you can include Dragons AND Dwarves AND Spirits etc, just a singular type

## Hero mechanics:
Your hero starts outside the game. Once per turn, anytime you could cast your hero, you may put it into your hand from outside the game and then immediately attempt to cast it. This is a special action and does not use the stack.
* If you fail to cast the hero for whatever reason, return it to the outside the game
	* This can happen if relying on mana abilities that produce an unknown amount of mana
* If it fails to resolve, it returns to outside the game
	* While putting the hero into hand is a special action that doesn't use the stack, it is cast normally and can be countered like normal spells
* As a state-based action, it can be removed the game after it has transitioned zones
	* “If a hero creature is in a graveyard or in exile and that object was put into that zone since the last time state-based actions were checked, its owner may remove it from the game.”

## Additional win cons:
Your creatures deals 18 player damage total over the course of the game.
