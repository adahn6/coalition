Coalition is a fast-paced and chaotic multiplayer format about leading creature coalitions into battle. It's a fusion of many existing formats of Magic but with a few unique twists. You'll build a sixty-card deck plus sideboard around a legendary "hero" creature. Choose a creature type printed anywhere on the hero creature; all other cards in the deck that have a creature type printed must have that type printed, forming a "coalition" around that type. 

As you play, you'll get points for all combat damage your creatures deal, as well as any other player damage dealt by your hero; reach 21 of these victory points and you win the game. But Coalition doesn't stop with game one-- it's intended to be played as best of 3. At the end of all three rounds, the overall winner is the player with the most combined victory points from all three matches.

Coalition plays a little differently than most other formats. It's aggressive and fast, like high power sixty card formats can be, but power limited by its Typal identities. Heroes seem similar to commanders, but the mechanical differences open up very different playstyles. Best of three matches add sideboard opportunities like in 1v1 formats, but also add a fun layer of archenemy metagame strategy. Give it a try-- we think you'll have a blast. 

## Why Play This Format?
* Fast, aggressive multiplayer games
* Creature typal decks are flavorful and fun to build
* Eternal format allows for a large deckbuilding pool
* Hybridizes 60 card playstyles with multiplayer magic

## Play Rules/Modifiers
This format is for 3-5 players per game and deck sizes are 60 cards + 10 sideboard cards. Players start with 25 life. Games are played in sets of three, and you'll sideboard in-between matches.  

## Win condition
As you play, you'll keep track of the combat damage your creatures deal other players, as well as any additional player damage dealt by your legendary creature. If this total reaches 21, you win the match! But it's not over there; Coalition is intended to be played as best of three games. You'll keep a total of your victory points across all three matched, whether you won or not, and the player at the end of three matches with the highest victory point total wins. 

As of writing, winning a game also confers a 5 point victory point reward. This is subject to further playtesting.

## Typal identity
A card's typal identies come from any part of that card that references a creature type, including its creature type or any creature type in its text. The only exception to this is that a negation of a type does not count (i.e. "non-Humans" does not contribute to typal identity). A card may have multiple Typal identities, or none at all. Every card in your deck must share a single typal identity, or have no typal identity.

## Deck format:

### Deck Restrictions: 
* No cards from the [banned cards list](BANLIST.MD)
* No legendary cards other than your hero in your 70 total cards
	* No companion or partner
* All cards in your deck share a single typal identity with your hero creature, or have no typal identity. *This type may not be Human*.
	* Typal identity is defined as “All creature types printed on the card, with the exception of ‘non-‘ type clauses”
		* Example: You can choose [Kaalia of the Vast](https://scryfall.com/card/2x2/235/kaalia-of-the-vast) and choose the Dragon type printed in her ability
		* Example: You can run [Portal to Phyrexia](https://scryfall.com/card/bro/240/portal-to-phyrexia) only if you are choosing Phyrexian creature type
		* Example: You can run [Swan Song](https://scryfall.com/card/c16/98/swan-song) only if you are choosing Bird creature type
		* Example: You can run [Bestial Menace](https://scryfall.com/card/mic/134/bestial-menace) if you are choosing any of Snake, Wolf, or Elephant types
		* Example: You can run [Aether Chaser](https://scryfall.com/card/aer/76/aether-chaser) if you are choosing either Artificer or Servo types
	* Note: “Non-[Creature Type]” clauses do not count as a creature type for this purpose
		* Example: All decks can run [Embiggen](https://scryfall.com/card/unf/137/embiggen) as its text “target non-Brushwagg creature” does not count as referencing the Brushwagg creature type
	* Note: As of writing, the new batch term "outlaw" is explicity defined by 700.12 as the batching of "Assassin, Mercenary, Pirate, Rogue, and/or Warlock" creature types. It should be treated as though those types were explicitly printed on the card; this is subject to change. 
	* Cards with changeling may be chosen for the legendary creature and may be included in any deck, however a singular shared type must be used for all cards that do not have changeling.
		* Example: [Morophon the Boundless](https://scryfall.com/card/cmm/3/morophon-the-boundless) can be chosen as the legendary, but that doesn’t mean you can include Dragons AND Dwarves AND Spirits etc, just a singular choice of those types
* Legendary creature must be a legendary creature on the front side of the card
	* Yes, [Grist, the Hunger Tide](https://scryfall.com/card/mh2/202/grist-the-hunger-tide) is allowed as a Hero, as her card text defines her as a Legendary Creature on the front side when not on the battlefield.

## Hero mechanics:
Your hero starts outside the game. Once on your turn, anytime you could cast your hero, you may put it into your hand from outside the game. This is a special action and does not use the stack.
* If it fails to resolve, it is treated like any other card
	* While putting the hero into hand is a special action that doesn't use the stack, it is cast normally and can be countered like normal spells
	* If it's put into the graveyard or exile because of this, you can use the state-based action after zone transition to remove it from the game again
* As a state-based action, it can be removed from the game after it has transitioned zones
	* “If a hero creature is in a graveyard or in exile and that object was put into that zone since the last time state-based actions were checked, its owner may remove it from the game.”
* As a replacement effect, if the hero creature would enter your library or hand, you may instead choose to remove it from the game

## Other rules modifications
Because Coalition has multiple players with multiple games played, there are special rules around conceding. While a player may still concede at any time for any reason, conceding automatically invalidates their victory points for that match, as if they had not played at all; they may then not play further matches. This rule is designed to prevent players weaponizing conceding advantageously.

As an exception to this rule, if all opponents of a player wish to concede simultaneously, the winning player receives the full 21 victory points and there are no penalties to any player who conceded. 
In rare situations, games may be forcibly ended in a draw by the rules via certain game states. If this happens, no penalties or bonuses are given and players simply use their existing victory points at the end of the game.
