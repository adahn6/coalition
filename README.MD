Coalition is a fast, high-power multiplayer format about leading creature coalitions into battle. Choose a legendary creature as the coalition's **leader**, then choose a non-Human creature type **affiliated** with it (any creature type it is or has printed on it). Build a 60-card deck plus sideboard where all cards are affiliated with the coalition type or are unaffiliated with any creature types.

Coalition is a played as a three-game match where all players compete for the most **victory points**. Players can earn up to 21 victory points per game from combat damage to opponents, and non-combat damage their coalition's leader deals to opponents. When any player reaches 21, they win the game. Regardless of winning or losing a game, every player adds all victory points they had at the end of the game to their ranking, and the winner of the match is the player with the highest ranking at the end of the third game. 

Coalition remixes a lot of elements from other formats into its own unique spin on Magic. It's fast and consistent, like high power sixty card formats, but balanced by deckbuilding and affiliation restrictions. Coalition leaders seem similar to commanders, but the mechanical differences open up very different playstyles. The three-game structure adds sideboard opportunities, and also adds a fun archenemy dynamic. Give it a try-- we think you'll have a blast. 

## Why Play This Format?
* Fast three-game multiplayer matches 
* Flavorful decks built around creature affiliations
* Eternal format with large card pool
* Hybrid of 60 card formats and multiplayer

## Play Rules/Modifiers
This format is primarily intended for 3-5 players per match. Deck sizes are 60 cards + 10 sideboard cards. Players start with 25 life. Matches are played in sets of three games, and players sideboard after each game.

There is no free mulligan, however like other multiplayer Magic formats the first player does draw a card. For the first game, decide the first player randomly; for games two and three, the player in last place may choose the first player.

## Victory points
Every player starts each game at zero victory points and can earn up to 21 per game in two ways: combat damage dealt to opponents, and non-combat damage their coalition's leader deals to opponents. Any player who reaches 21 victory points immediately wins the game; and [winning through any other means](https://scryfall.com/card/tsb/91/coalition-victory) grants the winner a final count of 21 victory points.

**At the end of each game, each player adds all victory points they acquired to their overall ranking**. Players are ranked from most to least in order, and the rankings at the end of game three are the final results used to determine placement. 

> [!TIP] 
> The ranking system here is very important, your victory points matter even if the game doesn't go your way! A deck that loses all three games but consistently racks up victory points may win the overall match, so don't get discouraged if you lose but still got a few good plays in.

## Affiliation
Affiliation describes what creature types a card is associated with. A card is affiliated with all creature types it is, as well as all creature types referenced in its Oracle text. As an exception, "non-[type]" negations do not count as a reference to a creature type. A card that is not affiliated with any creature types is unaffiliated.

A card's **affiliations** is shorthand for the set of creature types it is affiliated with.

> [!NOTE] 
> “Non-[Creature Type]” clauses do not count as a creature type for affiliation, e.g. [Embiggen](https://scryfall.com/card/unf/137/embiggen) is considered unaffiliated, as its text “target non-Brushwagg creature” does not make it affiliated with Brushwagg and it references no other creature types. You can put it in decks of any coalition!

## Deckbuilding
### Format

> [!NOTE] 
> Cards that explicitly override deckbuilding restrictions, such as [Relentless Rats](https://scryfall.com/card/a25/105/relentless-rats) or [Slime Against Humanity](https://scryfall.com/card/mkm/177/slime-against-humanity) may override these restrictions

### Restrictions
* No cards from the [banned cards list](BANLIST.MD)
* No legendary cards other than your coalition's leader in your 70 total cards
    * The legendary creature must be a legendary creature on the front side of the card
    * **This restriction applies to both sides of any double-faced cards, e.g. [Westvale Abbey](https://scryfall.com/card/soi/281/westvale-abbey-ormendahl-profane-prince) may not be run in any deck**
* A single creature type must be chosen as the coalition type
    * This type must be chosen from the legendary creature's affiliations
    * All cards in the deck must be [affiliated with the chosen coalition type or be unaffiliated](#Affiliation)
    * The chosen type [**may not be Human**](FAQ.md#why-cant-i-choose-human-as-an-affiliation-for-my-deck)
* No companion

### Affiliation restriction examples
* [Dermotaxi](https://scryfall.com/card/mh2/224/dermotaxi) is unaffiliated and may be run in any deck
* [Kaalia of the Vast](https://scryfall.com/card/2x2/235/kaalia-of-the-vast) can be chosen as a coalition's leader, and is affiliated with Human, Cleric, Angel, Demon, and Dragon; any of these may be chosen for the deck's coalition type [**except Human**](FAQ.md#why-cant-i-choose-human-as-an-affiliation-for-my-deck)
* [Portal to Phyrexia](https://scryfall.com/card/bro/240/portal-to-phyrexia) is affiliated with Phyrexians and can only be run in a Phyrexian coalition deck
* [Swan Song](https://scryfall.com/card/c16/98/swan-song) is affiliated with Birds and can only be run in a Bird coalition deck
* [Bestial Menace](https://scryfall.com/card/mic/134/bestial-menace) is affiliated with Snakes, Wolves, and Elephants, and can only be run in a deck of one of those coalition types
* [Aether Chaser](https://scryfall.com/card/aer/76/aether-chaser) is affiliated with Humans, Artificers, and Servos, and can only be run in an Artificer or Servo coalition deck ([**Human cannot be a coalition type)**](FAQ.md#why-cant-i-choose-human-as-an-affiliation-for-my-deck)
* [Celestial Colonnade](https://scryfall.com/card/uma/238/celestial-colonnade) is affiliated with Elementals, and can only be run in an Elemental coalition deck
* [Go-Shintai of Boundless Vigor](https://scryfall.com/card/neo/187/go-shintai-of-boundless-vigor) cannot be chosen as a coalition's leader as it is not affiliated with any creature types (Shrine is not a creature type!)

> [!IMPORTANT] 
> Creatures with changeling or other relevant characteristic defining abilities, e.g. [Morophon the Boundless](https://scryfall.com/card/cmm/3/morophon-the-boundless) or [Grist, the Hunger Tide](https://scryfall.com/card/mh2/202/grist-the-hunger-tide), follow rules for their characteristic defining abilities. For Morophon, changeling is an ability that grants it all creature types, thus it is affiliated with every creature type; the rules for a single coalition type still apply, one of these must be chosen and all cards in the deck must be affiliated with it. Grist can be chosen as a coalition's leader, but is only affilated with Insect.

## Coalition leaders
Your coalition's leader starts outside the game. Once on each of your turns, you may put it into your hand from outside the game as a sorcery. This is a special action and does not use the stack. A coalition's leader also has similar state-based actions and replacement effects to commanders:
* As a state-based action, a coalition's leader can be removed from the game after it has transitioned to graveyard or exile
* As a replacement effect, if a coalition's leader would enter your library or hand, you may instead choose to remove it from the game

Coalition leaders may be referred to shorthand as "leaders". For formal definitions of actions and effects for leaders, please check the [comprehensive rules modification](RULES.MD)
> [!TIP] 
> Coalition leaders may seem similar to commanders, but they act closer to a repeatable companion. After placing your coalition's leader into hand, you could cast it (and you'll never pay a tax for it!), or you could discard it and use a [reanimate effect](https://scryfall.com/search?q=otag%3Areanimate+-is%3Areserved+game%3Apaper&unique=cards&as=grid&order=name), or you could exile it to pay for [Force of Will](https://scryfall.com/card/dmr/50/force-of-will). It's up to you! 


## Conceding
While a player may still concede at any time for any reason, conceding automatically invalidates their victory points for that match-- they will not add victory points from that game to their ranking. Conceding within a game also removes a player from any remaining games in the match. This rule is designed to prevent players from conceding advantageously. **As an exception to this rule**, if all opponents of a player wish to concede a game simultaneously, this rule does not apply and it is simply as if the player being conceded to had won through any other method. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> In rare situations, games may be forcibly ended in a draw by the rules via certain game states. If this happens, or if the game is a draw for any other reason, or if a game has no winner for any reason, players simply add their existing victory points at the end of the game to their ranking.
