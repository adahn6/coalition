Coalition is a fast and frenzied multiplayer format about leading creature coalitions into battle. Choose a legendary creature as your **coalition leader**, then choose **any one creature type** printed anywhere on it-- this creature type is your coalition type. Build a 60-card deck plus sideboard where all cards are **affiliated** with your coalition type or are unaffiliated with any creature types.

As you play, you get victory points for all combat damage dealt. You also get victory points for any non-combat damage your coalition leader deals to opponents. You win a game if you reach 21 victory points-- but Coalition doesn't stop with game one, it's played as a match of three games. Regardless of winning or losing a game, add all victory points you had at the end of a game to your ranking, and the winner of the match is the player with the most at the end of the third game.

Coalition remixes a lot of elements from other formats into its own unique spin on Magic. It's fast and consistent, like high power sixty card formats can be, but power limited by affiliation restrictions. Coalition leaders seem similar to commanders, but the mechanical differences open up very different playstyles. The best-of-three structure adds sideboard opportunities like in 1v1 formats, but also add a fun layer of archenemy metagame strategy. Give it a try-- we think you'll have a blast. 

## Why Play This Format?
* Fast three-game multiplayer matches 
* Flavorful decks built around creature affiliations
* Eternal format with large card pool
* Hybridizes 60 card formats with multiplayer

## Play Rules/Modifiers
This format is primarily intended for 3-5 players per match. Deck sizes are 60 cards + 10 sideboard cards. Players start with 25 life. Matches are played in sets of three games, and players sideboard after each game.

There is no free mulligan, however like other multiplayer Magic formats the first player does draw a card. For the first game, decide the first player randomly; for games two and three, the player in last place may choose the first player.

## Victory points
Each player starts the game at zero victory points, and earns victory points for all combat damage dealt to opponents. Players also earn victory points for all non-combat damage their coalition leader deals to opponents. Any player who reaches 21 victory points immediately wins the game; and wining through any other means grants the winner 21 victory points. 

**At the end of each game, each player adds all victory points they acquired to their overall ranking**. Players are ranked from most to least in order, and the rankings at the end of game three are the final results used to determine placement. In the rare cases of draws, or all players losing, players simply use their victory point totals when the game ended.

> [!NOTE] 
> The ranking system here is very important, your victory points matter even if the game doesn't go your way! A deck that loses all three games but consistently racks up victory points may win the overall match, so don't get discouraged if you lose but still got a few good plays in.


## Affiliation
Affiliation describes what creature types a card is associated with. A card is affiliated with all creature types it is, as well as all creature types referenced in its Oracle text. As an exception, "non-[type]" negations do not count as a reference to a creature type. A card that is not affiliated with any creature types is unaffiliated.

A card's **affiliations** is shorthand for the set of creautre types it is affiliated with.

> [!NOTE] 
> “Non-[Creature Type]” clauses do not count as a creature type for affiliation, e.g. [Embiggen](https://scryfall.com/card/unf/137/embiggen) is considered unaffiliated, as its text “target non-Brushwagg creature” does not make it affiliated with Brushwagg and it references no other creature types. You can put it in decks of any coalition!

## Deckbuilding
### Format

* 1x non-creature, non-land cards
* Unlimited basic lands
> [!NOTE] 
> Cards that explicitly override deckbuilding restrictions, such as [Relentless Rats](https://scryfall.com/card/a25/105/relentless-rats) or [Slime Against Humanity](https://scryfall.com/card/mkm/177/slime-against-humanity) may override these restricitons

### Restrictions:
* No cards from the [banned cards list](BANLIST.MD)
* No legendary cards other than your coalition leader in your 70 total cards. 
    * The legendary creature must be a legendary creature on the front side of the card.
* A single affiliation must be chosen as the coalition type
    * This type must be chosen from the legendary creature's affiliations
    * All cards are [affiliated with the chosen coalition type or are unaffiliated](#Affiliation)
    * The chosen affiliation [**may not be Human**](FAQ.md#why-cant-i-choose-human-as-an-affiliation-for-my-deck)
* No companion

### Affiliation restriction examples:
* [Dermotaxi](https://scryfall.com/card/mh2/224/dermotaxi) is unaffiliated and may be run in any deck
* [Kaalia of the Vast](https://scryfall.com/card/2x2/235/kaalia-of-the-vast) can be chosen as a coalition leader, and is affiliated with Human, Cleric, Angel, Demon, and Dragon; any of these may be chosen for the deck's coalition type [**except Human**](FAQ.md#why-cant-i-choose-human-as-an-affiliation-for-my-deck)
* [Portal to Phyrexia](https://scryfall.com/card/bro/240/portal-to-phyrexia) is affiliated with Phyrexians and can only be run in a Phyrexian coalition deck
* [Swan Song](https://scryfall.com/card/c16/98/swan-song) is affiliated with Birds and can only be run in a Bird coalition deck
* [Bestial Menace](https://scryfall.com/card/mic/134/bestial-menace) is affiliated with Snakes, Wolves, and Elephants, and can be run only in deck of those coalition types
* [Aether Chaser](https://scryfall.com/card/aer/76/aether-chaser) is affiliated with Artificers and Servos, and can be run only in decks of those coalition types
* [Celestial Colonnade](https://scryfall.com/card/uma/238/celestial-colonnade) is affiliated with Elementals, and can only be run in an Elemental coalition deck
* [Go-Shintai of Boundless Vigor](https://scryfall.com/card/neo/187/go-shintai-of-boundless-vigor) cannot be chosen as a coalition leader as it is not affiliated with any creature type (Shrine is not a creature type!)

> [!NOTE] 
> Creatures with changeling or other relevant characteristic defining abilities, e.g. [Morophon the Boundless](https://scryfall.com/card/cmm/3/morophon-the-boundless) or [Grist, the Hunger Tide](https://scryfall.com/card/mh2/202/grist-the-hunger-tide), follow rules for their characteristic defining abilities. For the example of Morophon, changeling is an ability that grants it all creature types, thus it is affiliated with every type; a deck with Morophon as its leader must still choose a single type as the coalition type, and all cards must be affiliated with that type (or unaffiliated). Grist can be chosen as a coalition leader, but only has the option of leading an Insect coalition.

## Coalition leaders:
Your coalition leader starts outside the game. Once on each of your turns, you may put it into your hand from outside the game as a sorcery. This is a special action and does not use the stack. A coalition leader also has similar state-based actions and replacement effects to commanders:
* As a state-based action, a coalition leader can be removed from the game after it has transitioned to graveyard or exile
* As a replacement effect, if a coalition leader would enter your library or hand, you may instead choose to remove it from the game

For formal defintions of these actions and effects, please check the [comprehensive rules modification](RULES.MD)
> [!TIP] 
> Coalition leaders may seem similar to commanders, but they act closer to a repeatable companion. After placing your coalition leader into hand, you could cast it (and you'll never pay a tax for it!), or you could discard it and use a [reanimate effect](https://scryfall.com/search?q=otag%3Areanimate+-is%3Areserved+game%3Apaper&unique=cards&as=grid&order=name), or you could exile it to pay for [Force of Will](https://scryfall.com/card/dmr/50/force-of-will). It's up to you! 


## Other rules modifications
Because Coalition has multiple players with multiple games played, there are special rules around conceding. While a player may still concede at any time for any reason, conceding automatically invalidates their victory points for that match, as if they had not played at all; they may then not play further matches. This rule is designed to prevent players from conceding advantageously. As an exception to this rule, if all opponents of a player wish to concede simultaneously, this rule does not apply and it is simply as if the player being conceded to had won through any other method. 

In rare situations, games may be forcibly ended in a draw by the rules via certain game states. If this happens, or if the game is a draw for any other reason, no penalties are given and players simply use their existing victory points at the end of the game. 

## Quick rules

### Coming from Commander:
While Coalition is very different from Commander, the following section has an itemized summary of differences:

  * **No command tax**!
* Players start at **25 life**
* There is **no free mulligan**
* **No color identity** restrictions; but instead, there is the new **affiliation** restrictions

  * 4x lands, 4x creatures, 1x all other cards  
* **No commander damage** lose condition, but instead a new **victory point win condition**
  * A player gains victory points for all **combat damage from creatures they control**
  * A player gains victory points from **all non-combat damage their coalition leader deals to opponents**
  * A player wins the game when they reach 21 victory points
  * A player winning the game by any other means gains 21 victory points for that game, regardless of how many they had before winning
  * A player can never gain more than 21 victory points per game
* **Best of 3**
  * A match is played in a set of 3 games
  * After each game, players may **sideboard**
  * After each game, each player adds the victory points they had at the end of the game to their match total
  * For game 1, decide the first player randomly. For games 2 and 3, the player with the least points chooses the first player. In the case of a tie, decide randomly which of those players chooses.
