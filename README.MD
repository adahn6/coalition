Coalition is a fast-paced and chaotic multiplayer format about leading creature coalitions into battle. It's a fusion of many existing formats of Magic but with a few unique twists. You'll build a sixty-card deck plus sideboard around a legendary "hero" creature. Choose a creature type printed anywhere on the hero creature; all other cards in the deck must be "affiliated" with that type, forming your coalition.

As you play, you'll get points for all combat damage your creatures deal, as well as any other player damage dealt by your hero; reach 21 of these victory points and you win the game. But Coalition doesn't stop with game one-- it's intended to be played as best of 3. At the end of all three rounds, the overall winner is the player with the most combined victory points from all three matches.

Coalition plays a little differently than most other formats. It's aggressive and fast, like high power sixty card formats can be, but power limited by its typal identities. Heroes seem similar to commanders, but the mechanical differences open up very different playstyles. Best of three matches add sideboard opportunities like in 1v1 formats, but also add a fun layer of archenemy metagame strategy. Give it a try-- we think you'll have a blast. 

## Why Play This Format?
* Fast, aggressive multiplayer games
* Creature typal decks are flavorful and fun to build
* Eternal format allows for a large deckbuilding pool
* Hybridizes 60 card playstyles with multiplayer magic

## Play Rules/Modifiers
This format is for 3-5 players per game and deck sizes are 60 cards + 10 sideboard cards. Players start with 25 life. Games are played in sets of three, and you'll sideboard in-between matches.  

## Win condition
As you play, you'll keep track of the combat damage your creatures deal other players, as well as any additional player damage dealt by your legendary creature. If this total reaches 21, you win the match! But it's not over there; Coalition is intended to be played as best of three games. You'll keep a total of your victory points across all three matched, whether you won or not, and the player at the end of three matches with the highest victory point total wins. 

As of writing, winning a game also confers a 5 point victory point reward. This is subject to further playtesting.

## Affiliation
A card's affiliation come from any part of that card that references a creature type, including its creature type or any creature type in its text. The only exception to this is that a negation of a type does not count (i.e. "non-Humans" does not contribute to typal identity). A card is affiliated with all creature types printed this way.

## Deck Restrictions:
* No cards from the [banned cards list](BANLIST.MD)
* No legendary cards other than your hero in your 70 total cards. The legendary creature must be a legendary creature on the front side of the card.
* All cards are affiliated with a single chosen creature type
* No companion or partner

Examples of typal identity choices for decks:
* With [Kaalia of the Vast](https://scryfall.com/card/2x2/235/kaalia-of-the-vast) as your hero, you can choose Dragon from the Dragon type printed in her ability
* You can run [Portal to Phyrexia](https://scryfall.com/card/bro/240/portal-to-phyrexia) only if you are choosing Phyrexian affiliation
* You can run [Swan Song](https://scryfall.com/card/c16/98/swan-song) only if you are choosing Bird affiliation
* You can run [Bestial Menace](https://scryfall.com/card/mic/134/bestial-menace) if you are choosing any of Snake, Wolf, or Elephant affiliations
* You can run [Aether Chaser](https://scryfall.com/card/aer/76/aether-chaser) if you are choosing either Artificer or Sero affiliations
	
> [!NOTE] 
> “Non-[Creature Type]” clauses do not count as a creature type for this purpose, e.g. all decks can run [Embiggen](https://scryfall.com/card/unf/137/embiggen) as its text “target non-Brushwagg creature” does not count as referencing the Brushwagg creature type

> [!NOTE] 
> As of writing, the new batch term "outlaw" is explicity defined by 700.12 as the batching of "Assassin, Mercenary, Pirate, Rogue, and/or Warlock" creature types; it should be treated as though those types were explicitly printed on the card; this is subject to change. 

> [!NOTE] 
> Legendary creatures with changeling, e.g. [Morophon the Boundless](https://scryfall.com/card/cmm/3/morophon-the-boundless), may be chosen as a hero, and non-legendary changelings, e.g. [Changeling Outcast](https://scryfall.com/card/otc/128/changeling-outcast), may be included in any deck; however a singular shared affiliation must be chosen and shared by all cards that do not have changeling.

## Hero mechanics:
Your hero starts outside the game. Once on your turn, anytime you could cast your hero, you may put it into your hand from outside the game. This is a special action and does not use the stack.
* While putting a hero into hand is a special action that doesn't use the stack, it is then simply a card in hand; what you do with it from there is up to you
* As a state-based action, it can be removed from the game after it has transitioned zones
	* “If a hero is in a graveyard or in exile and that object was put into that zone since the last time state-based actions were checked, its owner may remove it from the game. This is a state-based action. See rule 704"
* As a replacement effect, if a hero would enter your library or hand, you may instead choose to remove it from the game
	* "If a hero would be put into its owner’s hand or library from anywhere, its owner may remove it from the game instead. This replacement effect may apply more than once to the same event. This is an exception to rule 614.5."

## Other rules modifications
Because Coalition has multiple players with multiple games played, there are special rules around conceding. While a player may still concede at any time for any reason, conceding automatically invalidates their victory points for that match, as if they had not played at all; they may then not play further matches. This rule is designed to prevent players from conceding advantageously.

As an exception to this rule, if all opponents of a player wish to concede simultaneously, the winning player receives the full 21 victory points and there are no penalties to any player who conceded. 

In rare situations, games may be forcibly ended in a draw by the rules via certain game states. If this happens, no penalties or bonuses are given and players simply use their existing victory points at the end of the game.
