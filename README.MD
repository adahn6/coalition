# Heroic format
A new multiplayer format intended to be faster, cheaper, more consistent, and more aggressive than Commander. Build a deck around a legendary hero creature, fill the deck with cards of that type. But no other legendaries allowed! As your hero deals damage or kills other creatures, it will level up making it increasingly dangerous. The goal of the format is make fast, aggressive decks dealing combat damage to players a first-class win condition. 

Deck size: 60 with 8 card sideboard
Number of players: 3-5
Game duration: 30 minutes

## Why Play This Format?
* Fast pace multi-player games
* Cards don't rotate

## Play Rules/Modifiers

This format is for 3-5 players per game and deck sizes are 60 cards + 8 sideboard cards. One sideboard card must be a legendary creature.

In Heroic format, you'll build a deck around a legendary hero creature leading a creature type army into battle. As your hero deals player damage or kills other creatures, it will level up making it increasingly dangerous.

## Typal identity
A card's typal identity comes from any part of that card that references a creature type, including its creature type or any creature type in its text. Every card in your Heroic deck must share a single typal identity.

## Hero Damage

Your hero will win you the game if it deals 17 player damage. This damage is tracked as damage done by the hero, so if your hero is stolen and damages you, the damage you take can win you the game!

## Deck format:
* 1 legendary creature referred to as your hero creature.
* 60 cards
* 8 card sideboard that includes the legendary hero
* Up to 4x of creatures
* Up to 4x of any nonbasic lands, unlimited basics
* All other card must be singleton
* No legendary cards other than your hero
	* No companion or partner
* All cards in your deck share a single typal identity with your hero creature, or have no typal identity.
Typal identity is defined as “All creature types printed on the card, with the exception of ‘non-‘ type clauses”
For example, you can choose Kaalia and choose the Dragon type printed in her ability
To run “Portal to Phyrexia”, you must have chosen the Phyrexian creature type
To run “Swan Song”, you must have chosen the Bird creature type
To run “Bestial Menace”, you must have chosen either Snake, Wolf, or Elephant
To run “Aether Chaser”, you must have chosen either Artificer or Servo
Note: “Non-[Creature Type]” clauses do not count as a creature type for this purpose
E.g. all decks can run “Embiggen”-- its text “target non-Brushwagg creature” does not count as referencing the Brushwagg creature type
Your hero card does not use the command zone
Once per turn, anytime you could cast your hero, you may put it into your hand from outside the game and cast it. This is a special action and does not use the stack.
If it fails to resolve, it returns to outside the game
If this is the fourth time the hero creature spell resolves this way, you lose the game at the end of your turn.
As a SBA, it can be removed the game anytime states are check after it has transitioned zones
“If a hero creature is in a graveyard or in exile and that object was put into that zone since the last time state-based actions were checked, its owner may remove it from the game.”
Cards with changeling may be chosen for the legendary creature and may be included in any deck, however a singular shared type must be used for all cards that do not have changeling. Human is still not a valid choice.
i.e. Morphon the Boundless can be chosen as the legendary, but that doesn’t mean you can include Dragons AND Dwarves AND Spirits etc, just a singular type
Win cons (other than the usual):
Your hero creature deals 17 damage total over the course of the game 
Lose cons:
At the end of your turn, if you have cast and resolved your hero creature four times from outside the game, you lose.
This is a SBA done every cleanup step.
