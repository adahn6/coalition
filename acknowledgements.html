                            <dd>everything I know about Magic, I know from you. This format would never exist without your constant attentiveness to detail, your endless patience for my hairbraned ideas, and your weirdly in-depth knowledge of the comprehensive rules.</dd>

                            <dd>not only would this website not exist without you, my sanity probably wouldn't either. Your endless patience for my opinionating and figuring out how to make website and games is enormously appreciated, and your constant creative drive is an inspiration.</dd>
