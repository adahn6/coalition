          <h2>Overview</h2>
          <p>
            Coalition is an eternal multiplayer format for Magic: The Gathering, played as a match of three games competing for the most <a href="#victorypoints">victory points</a>. Earn victory points equal to the combat damage you deal to opponents; reach 21 to win the game. At the end of each game, everyone adds their victory points to the scoreboard ranking, and whoever has the most points at the end of the match wins.
          </p>
  
          <p>
            Coalition decks are built around creature types. To build one, you'll choose a <a href="#leaders">leader</a>, then build a 60-card deck plus sideboard around one of its creature type <a href="#affiliation">affiliations</a>.

              Players start each game at zero victory points and earn them equal to the combat damage they deal to opponents; reach 21 and win the game.

            <p>
              Your coalition's leader is any legendary creature. It starts outside the game in your sideboard, and once on each of your turns, you may put it into your hand from outside the game. Leaders <a href="faq.html#commander">are not Commanders</a>, but do have similar state-based actions and replacement effects: they can be removed from the game again if or when they transition zones.

              Affiliation describes the creature types that are associated with a card. A card is affiliated with all creature types it is, as well as all creature types referenced in its Oracle text. As an exception, "non-[type]" negations do not count as a reference to a creature type.
            </p>

            <p>Every deck chooses one creature type to form a coalition around, and all cards in the deck will need to be affiliated with that creature type (or unaffiliated).</p>

          <dl>
            <dt><a href="faq.html#turnorder">Turn order</a></dt>
            <dd>
              For game 1, randomly determine the turn order. For games 2 and 3, use the inverse of the current ranking, e.g. the player with the least victory points goes first, the player with the next least goes second, etc. In the case of ties, the player had a lower turn ranking in the previous game should go before the other.
            </dd>

            <dt>Mulligans</dt>
            <dd>
              There is no free mulligan
            </dd>

            <dt>First player draw</dt>
            <dd>
              The first player does draw a card.
            </dd>

            <dt>Conceding</dt>
            <dd>
              While a player may concede at any time for any reason, conceding automatically invalidates their victory points for that match. The player's ranking is set to 0, and they are removed from any remaining games in the match. As an exception to this rule, if all opponents of a player wish to concede a game simultaneously, this rule does not apply and it is simply as if the player being conceded to had won through any other method.
            </dd>
            <dt>Ties</dt>
            <dd>
              In the case of any ties at the end of a match, the player with the highest life total at the end of game 3 should be considered the winner. 
            </dd>
            <dt>Slow play</dt>
            <dd>
              While player discussions are normal, it’s critical to the format that games complete in time. Accordingly, discussions and negotiations are expected to stay timely.
