A WIP modification of Magic The Gathering: Comprehensive Rules for "Heroic":


906. Heroic

* 906.1. In the Heroic variant, each deck is led by a legendary creature designated as that deck's Hero. The Heroic format was created by fans. The Heroic variant uses all the normal rules for a Magic game, with the following additions.

* 906.2. A Heroic game may be a two-player game or a multiplayer game. The default multiplayer setup is the Free-for-All variant with the attack multiple players option and without the limited range of influence option. See rule 806, “Free-for-All Variant.”

* 906.3. Each deck has a legendary creature card designated as its "Hero". This designation is not a characteristic of the object represented by the card; rather, it is an attribute of the card itself. The card retains this designation even when it changes zones.
	* Example: A hero that’s been turned face down (due to Ixidron’s effect, for example) is still a hero. A hero that’s copying another card (due to Cytoshape’s effect, for example) is still a hero. A permanent that’s copying a hero (such as a Body Double, for example, copying a hero in a player’s graveyard) is not a hero

	* 906.3a Double-faced cards can be the Hero as long as the front face of the card has the types legendary creature.

* 906.4 The Heroic variant uses typal identity to determine what cards can be in a deck with a certain Hero. The typal identity of a card is any creature type printed on the text of the card, including its creature type and any ability text of the card. A card may have multiple typal idenities, or no typal identity.

	* 906.4a Typal identity is established before the game begins, and is affected by Changeling.
		* Example: Morphon the Boundless is all creature types, as it has Changeling.

	* 906.4b Reminder text is ignored when determining color identity.

	* 906.5c The back face of a double-faced card is included when determining a card's typal identity. This is an exception to rule 712.8a.

* 906.5 Each Heroic deck is subject to the following deck construction rules.

	* 906.6a Each deck must contain exactly 60 cards and an 8 card sideboard. The hero creature starts the game in the sideboard and is not part of the 60 deck.

	* 906.6b Each creature card may be included a maximum of four times.

	* 906.6c Each non-basic land card may be included a maximum of four times.

	* 906.6d Each non-creature, non-land card must have a different English name.

	* 906.6e Every card in a heroic deck and its sideboard must share a single chosen typal identity. Cards with no typal identity are not subject to this restriction.

	* 906.6f The deck must contain a legendary creature in its sideboard, designated its Hero.

	* 906.6f The deck must not contain banned cards. A ban list is maintained in this repository.

* 906.7 Once the starting player has been determined, each player sets their life total to 25 and draws a hand of seven cards.

* 906.8 Once per turn, a player may put their hero into their hand from outside the game and cast it. 
	* 906.8a Should it fail to resolve after being cast this way, it returns to outside the game. 

* 906.9 If a Hero would be exiled from anywhere or put into its owner's hand, graveyard, or library from anywhere, its owner may remove it from the game instead. This replacement effect may apply more than once to the same event.

* 906.10 Players start the game with a “Hero Level” emblem in the command zone. This is an emblem that reads 
```
The first time each turn your hero creature deals player damage or kills a creature, it gains its next ability. Hero levels are gained from top to bottom and once they are gained they are kept for the rest of the game.

Whenever a hero creature you own levels up, exile the top card of your library face down and look at it. You may put that card into hand, or add one mana of any type. Until end of turn, you don’t lose mana added this way as steps and phases end. If a hero would level up but is already at maximum level, you still do this.
```

| Level  | Ability |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| 0  | Whenever a hero creature you own becomes the target of a spell or ability an opponent controls, counter it unless that player pays generic mana equal to its level. |
| 1  | Hero creatures you own can attack and tap as soon as they come under your control. |
| 2  | Hero creatures you own cannot be blocked except by two or more creatures. | 
| 3  | Attacking doesn’t cause hero creatures you own to tap. | 
| 4  | Hero creatures you own can deal excess combat damage to a player, planeswalker or battle they are attacking. | 
| 5  | Hero creatures you own can’t be destroyed. |

* 903.11. The Heroic variant includes the following specification for winning and losing the game.
All other rules for ending the game also apply. (See rule 104.)
	* 903.11a If a player has resolved casting their hero four times after bringing it into hand from outside the game, they lose the game at the end of their turn. This is done as a state-based action during the cleanup step. 
	* 903.11b If a Hero deals 17 total damage to players, that Hero's owner wins the game immediately.
