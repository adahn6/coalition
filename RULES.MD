A WIP modification of Magic The Gathering: Comprehensive Rules for "Coalition":


906. Coalition

* 906.1. In the Coalition variant, each deck is led by a legendary creature designated as that deck's Hero. The Coalition format was created by fans. The Coalition variant uses all the normal rules for a Magic game, with the following additions.

* 906.2. A Coalition game may be a two-player game or a multiplayer game. The default multiplayer setup is the Free-for-All variant with the attack multiple players option and without the limited range of influence option. See rule 806, “Free-for-All Variant.”

* 906.3. Each deck has a legendary creature card designated as its "Hero". This designation is not a characteristic of the object represented by the card; rather, it is an attribute of the card itself. The card retains this designation even when it changes zones.
	* Example: A hero that’s been turned face down (due to Ixidron’s effect, for example) is still a hero. A hero that’s copying another card (due to Cytoshape’s effect, for example) is still a hero. A permanent that’s copying a hero (such as a Body Double, for example, copying a hero in a player’s graveyard) is not a hero

	* 906.3a Double-faced cards can be the Hero as long as the front face of the card has the types legendary creature.

* 906.4 The Coalition variant uses typal identity to determine what cards can be in a deck with a certain Hero. The typal identity of a card is any creature type printed on the text of the card, including its creature type and any ability text of the card. A card may have multiple typal idenities, or no typal identity.

	* 906.4a Typal identity is established before the game begins, and is affected by Changeling.
		* Example: Morphon the Boundless is all creature types, as it has Changeling.

	* 906.4b Reminder text is ignored when determining typal identity.

	* 906.5c The back face of a double-faced card is included when determining a card's typal identity. This is an exception to rule 712.8a.

* 906.5 Each Coalition deck is subject to the following deck construction rules.

	* 906.6a Each deck must contain exactly 60 cards and an 8 card sideboard. The hero creature starts the game in the sideboard and is not part of the 60 deck.

	* 906.6b Each creature card may be included a maximum of four times.

	* 906.6c Each non-basic land card may be included a maximum of four times.

	* 906.6d Each non-creature, non-land card must have a different English name.

	* 906.6e Every card in a Coalition deck and its sideboard must share a single chosen typal identity. Cards with no typal identity are not subject to this restriction.

	* 906.6f The deck must contain a legendary creature in its sideboard, designated its Hero.

	* 906.6f The deck must not contain banned cards. A ban list is maintained in this repository.

* 906.7 Once the starting player has been determined, each player sets their life total to 25 and draws a hand of seven cards.

* 906.8 Once per turn, a player may put their hero into their hand from outside the game. 

* 906.9 If a Hero would be exiled from anywhere or put into its owner's hand, graveyard, or library from anywhere, its owner may remove it from the game instead. This replacement effect may apply more than once to the same event.

* 906.10 The first time each turn a hero creature deals player damage, its owner chooses to either "Flourish", defined as drawing a card (or, should an effect prevent this and no card is drawn this way, place the top card of their library into hand), or Prosper, defined as "Scry 1, then create a tapped Treasure token."

* 903.11. The Coalition variant includes the following specification for winning and losing the game.
All other rules for ending the game also apply. (See rule 104.)
	* 903.11b A player wins the game if creatures they own have dealt a total of 21 combat damage, combined with any additional player damage dealt by their Hero creature.
